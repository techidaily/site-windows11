    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Boosting-WinOS-Stop-Autominize-Apps"><a href="#Boosting-WinOS-Stop-Autominize-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Boosting WinOS: Stop Autominize Apps"></a>Boosting WinOS: Stop Autominize Apps</h2><p> One day, you’re using your Windows device and realize that some apps minimize themselves without warning. But why are you encountering this issue? Well, there are several potential causes—ranging from misconfigured settings to malware infections.</p><p> Fortunately, we’ve got all the solutions that’ll help you resolve this problem. So, let’s explore why you’re encountering this issue and how you can tackle it.</p><h2 id="Why-Do-Your-Programs-Automatically-Minimize-Themselves"><a href="#Why-Do-Your-Programs-Automatically-Minimize-Themselves" class="headerlink" title="Why Do Your Programs Automatically Minimize Themselves?"></a>Why Do Your Programs Automatically Minimize Themselves?</h2><p> Here are some common reasons why your programs may be automatically minimizing themselves:</p><ul><li><strong>Focus Stealing</strong>: Certain apps or background processes may steal the focus from an active program and cause it to minimize. This can happen due to notifications, pop-up messages, or other system events that require attention.</li><li><strong>Misconfigured Multitasking Settings</strong>: Windows has built-in multitasking features such as the “Snap windows” tool. Such features allow you to automatically arrange a window when you drag it to the edge of the screen. But if these tools are misconfigured, they can cause programs to minimize unexpectedly.</li><li><strong>Faulty Display Drivers</strong>: Outdated or corrupted display drivers can cause conflicts with apps and make your apps minimize themselves unexpectedly.</li><li><strong>Compatibility Issues</strong>: Some programs may not be fully compatible with your Windows version. So, such apps might often minimize themselves as a response to compatibility issues.</li><li><strong>Third-Party Software Interference</strong>: Sometimes, certain third-party apps (such as antivirus programs) can conflict with other programs and cause them to minimize without warning.</li><li><strong>Malware or Viruses</strong>: Malicious software can interfere with your programs and cause them to minimize themselves or behave unexpectedly.</li></ul><p> Now, it’s time to explore the solutions.</p><h2 id="1-Disable-Unnecessary-Background-Processes"><a href="#1-Disable-Unnecessary-Background-Processes" class="headerlink" title="1. Disable Unnecessary Background Processes"></a>1. Disable Unnecessary Background Processes</h2><p> If the issue is caused by focus stealing, then stopping some of your background processes could help. Here’s how you can do it:</p><ol><li>Press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</strong> to open the Task Manager.</li><li>Navigate to the <strong>Processes</strong> tab.</li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>Background processes</strong> section.</li><li>Right-click on the processes that you deem unnecessary and select <strong>End Task</strong> to stop them.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stopping-a-background-processes-on-the-task-manager.jpg"                      alt="Stopping a background processes on the Task Manager"                ></p><p> Close the Task Manager and restart your device to save these changes.</p><p> Keep in mind that some background processes are essential for the proper functioning of your PC. So, exercise caution when terminating processes in the Task Manager. If you’re unsure about a particular process, research it first to ensure that it’s safe to stop.</p><h2 id="2-Configure-the-Windows-Multitasking-Settings"><a href="#2-Configure-the-Windows-Multitasking-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Configure the Windows Multitasking Settings"></a>2. Configure the Windows Multitasking Settings</h2><p> There’s a high chance that your apps minimize themselves because of the way you’ve configured the multitasking settings. So, let’s check out the few tweaks you should make to tackle this problem:</p><ol><li>Press <strong>Win + I</strong> to open the system settings.</li><li>Click the <strong>System</strong> option.</li><li>Select <strong>Multitasking</strong> from the options on the left.</li><li>Uncheck the <strong>When I snap a window, automatically size it to fill available space</strong> option. When this option is enabled, you can make an app fill the entire screen by dragging it to the edge. But this will automatically minimize other apps, which is something you probably don’t want to do.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/configuring-the-multitasking-settings.jpg"                      alt="Configuring the Multitasking Settings"                ></p><p> If the issue persists, consider disabling the box in the bottom part of the “Snap windows” section. Alternatively, you could consider turning off the “Snap windows” feature.</p><h2 id="3-Update-the-Display-Drivers-or-Run-the-Compatibility-Troubleshooter"><a href="#3-Update-the-Display-Drivers-or-Run-the-Compatibility-Troubleshooter" class="headerlink" title="3. Update the Display Drivers or Run the Compatibility Troubleshooter"></a>3. Update the Display Drivers or Run the Compatibility Troubleshooter</h2><p> By <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/" >updating the display drivers on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you provide a stable and compatible graphics environment for your PC. Not only will this reduce the chances of programs automatically minimizing, but it’ll also tackle other system issues.</p><p> And if you suspect that the error is caused by compatibility issues, then the compatibility troubleshooter should help. The tool will attempt to detect and resolve any compatibility issues related to the program.</p><p> Here are the steps to run the compatibility troubleshooter on Windows:</p><ol><li>Press <strong>Win + I</strong> to open the system settings.</li><li>Click <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> from the options.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> on the left-hand side.</li><li>Click the <strong>Additional troubleshooters</strong> option on the right.</li><li>Select the <strong>Program Compatibility Troubleshooter</strong> option and click the <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong> button.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/running-the-compatibility-troubleshooter.jpg"                      alt="Running the Compatibility Troubleshooter"                ></p><p> To further resolve compatibility issues, consider <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/" >updating your Windows device <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="4-Resolve-Software-Conflicts"><a href="#4-Resolve-Software-Conflicts" class="headerlink" title="4. Resolve Software Conflicts"></a>4. Resolve Software Conflicts</h2><p> We discovered earlier that security software (or faulty third-party apps) can interfere with the normal functioning of other programs. This means it’s likely that such programs could cause other apps to minimize unexpectedly.</p><p> Now, let’s explore how to resolve software conflicts that stem from security software or faulty third-party apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Identify Suspicious Software</strong>: Take note of any recently installed software that’s likely causing other apps to minimize unexpectedly.</li><li><strong>Temporarily Disable or Reinstall Security Software</strong>: Temporarily disable security software (such as antivirus programs) and see if that helps. And if you’re using a third-party security program, uninstall it temporarily and check if that resolves the issue. From there, reinstall the tool from a reputed website.</li><li><strong>Update Conflicting Software</strong>: If you suspect the issue is caused by outdated third-party apps, try updating those apps and see if that tackles the issue.</li></ul><p> So, what if the issue stems from malware? In that case, you’d need to clean up your PC with <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-malware-removal-tools-pc/" >the best malware removal tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="5-Turn-Off-Game-Mode"><a href="#5-Turn-Off-Game-Mode" class="headerlink" title="5. Turn Off Game Mode"></a>5. Turn Off Game Mode</h2><p> Game Mode is a Windows feature designed to optimize system performance for gaming. However, it may sometimes interfere with some tools and cause them to minimize unexpectedly. This means disabling the “Game Mode” feature can be a potential solution to the issue at hand.</p><p> So, let’s check out how you can turn this feature off:</p><ol><li>Press <strong>Win + I</strong> to open the system settings.</li><li>Select <strong>Gaming</strong> from the options.</li><li>Click <strong>Game Mode</strong> on the left-hand side.</li><li><strong>Turn off</strong> the “Game Mode” button on the right-hand side pane.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/turning-off-game-mode-on-windows.jpg"                      alt="Turning Off Game Mode on Windows"                ></p><p> Close the settings app and check if this resolves the issue.</p><p> Turning off Game Mode may slightly affect gaming performance because the system will no longer focus on allocating resources specifically for gaming.</p><h2 id="6-Run-the-System-Maintenance-Troubleshooter"><a href="#6-Run-the-System-Maintenance-Troubleshooter" class="headerlink" title="6. Run the System Maintenance Troubleshooter"></a>6. Run the System Maintenance Troubleshooter</h2><p> Maybe the issue at hand is caused by system maintenance problems. And in that case, running the System Maintenance troubleshooter should help tackle the problem. So, let’s take you through how you can use this tool:</p><ol><li>Type <strong>Perform recommended maintenance tasks automatically</strong> in the Start menu search bar.</li><li>Select the <strong>Best match</strong> result to open the System Maintenance troubleshooter.</li><li>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> option and then check the <strong>Apply repairs automatically</strong> box.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong> and follow the on-screen steps to finalize the process.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Running-the-System-Maintenance-Troubleshooter-on-Windows.jpg"                      alt="Running the System Maintenance Troubleshooter on Windows"                ></p><h2 id="7-Edit-the-Registry-Editor"><a href="#7-Edit-the-Registry-Editor" class="headerlink" title="7. Edit the Registry Editor"></a>7. Edit the Registry Editor</h2><p> As a last resort, you could consider tweaking some settings in the Registry Editor. But make sure you <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/" >back up the Registry <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> first before you proceed. That’s because you might wreak havoc on your PC if you mistakenly tweak the wrong Registry keys.</p><p> To resolve the issue at hand, you’ll have to tweak the ForegroundLockTimeout registry key. This is a setting that controls the timeout duration for foreground processes. Simply put, it determines the amount of time a process must remain in the foreground before the device considers it unresponsive.</p><p> To ensure that everything runs smoothly, you’ll have to set the value of the ForegroundLockTimeout registry key to its default.</p><p> Here are the steps you need to follow:</p><ol><li>Type <strong>Registry Editor</strong> in the Start menu search bar and select the <strong>Best match</strong> result.</li><li>Copy-paste the following command into the address bar and press <strong>Enter</strong>:</li></ol><p>Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop</p><p> From there, double-click on the <strong>ForegroundLockTimeout</strong> value on the right-hand side pane.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/clicking-the-foregroundlocktimeout-value-in-the-registry-editor.jpg"                      alt="Clicking the ForegroundLockTimeout value in the Registry Editor"                ></p><p> Next, set its Value data to <strong>249f0</strong> and then click <strong>OK</strong>. This is the default value that should help get rid of the issue at hand. Finally, close the Registry Editor and restart your device to save these changes.</p><h2 id="Say-Goodbye-to-App-Minimizing-Issues"><a href="#Say-Goodbye-to-App-Minimizing-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Say Goodbye to App Minimizing Issues"></a>Say Goodbye to App Minimizing Issues</h2><p> It can be quite irritating when apps decide to minimize themselves without your permission. But if you apply the tips we’ve covered, you should be able to tackle this problem in no time.</p><p> Fortunately, we’ve got all the solutions that’ll help you resolve this problem. So, let’s explore why you’re encountering this issue and how you can tackle it.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/vanishing-acts-concealing-keys-without-notice/"><u>Vanishing Acts: Concealing Keys Without Notice</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/revive-slow-windows-apps-ensure-robust-web-linkage/"><u>Revive Slow Windows Apps: Ensure Robust Web Linkage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/correcting-batched-taskbar-visual-elements/"><u>Correcting Batched Taskbar Visual Elements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/advance-windows-11-task-manager-refresh-speeds/"><u>Advance Windows 11 Task Manager Refresh Speeds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/exploring-soft-dependency-management-in-win-environments/"><u>Exploring Soft Dependency Management in Win Environments</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/winning-the-battle-against-windows-software-problems-7-ways/"><u>Winning the Battle Against Windows Software Problems (7 Ways)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/bridging-the-gap-fix-for-non-openable-windows-exe-files/"><u>Bridging the Gap: Fix for Non-Openable Windows .exe Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/8-ways-to-fix-the-windows-desktop-when-it-turns-pink-or-purple/"><u>8 Ways to Fix the Windows Desktop When It Turns Pink or Purple</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/exploring-aggregatorhostexe-in-windows-how-it-works-and-safety-aspects/"><u>Exploring AggregatorHost.exe in Windows: How It Works and Safety Aspects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/precision-in-picture-editing-eliminating-backgrounds-effectively/"><u>Precision in Picture Editing: Eliminating Backgrounds Effectively</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/cutting-edge-technology-of-nikon-d7500-reviewed/"><u>Cutting-Edge Technology of Nikon D7500 Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-audio-transition-smoothness-in-audacity/"><u>[New] Enhancing Audio Transition Smoothness in Audacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-snipping-videophotographs-in-windows-11/"><u>In 2024, Snipping Videophotographs in Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-design-principles-for-captivating-fb-advertising/"><u>[Updated] Design Principles for Captivating FB Advertising</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-the-artisan-writes-crafting-hdr-magic-with-iphone/"><u>[Updated] The Artisan’ Writes  Crafting HDR Magic with iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-solo-self-portraits-on-youtube-how-to-impress-viewers/"><u>In 2024, Solo Self-Portraits on YouTube  How to Impress Viewers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/breaking-into-twitter-live-your-strategy-for-2024/"><u>Breaking Into Twitter Live  Your Strategy for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-expert-tips-for-mac-users-audacitys-audio-recording-features/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Expert Tips for Mac Users  Audacity's Audio Recording Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-vivo-v30-pro-lock-screen-clock-in-seconds-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Change Vivo V30 Pro Lock Screen Clock in Seconds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-demystifying-income-flow-to-creators-within-the-short-video-model/"><u>[New] In 2024, Demystifying Income Flow to Creators Within the Short Video Model</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

This helps avoid clutter and offers everything in one place, thus making it easier to find what you are looking for.</p><p> That said, by default, Windows has no option to merge folders. Even though it is clever enough to identify multiple folders of the identical name at the same level, there are more efficient ways to merge folders and files in Windows 10 and 11.</p><p> Here we show you the best ways to merge folders on a Windows 10 and 11 system. It includes the convenient File Explorer merge option, a PowerShell script hack and third-party tools to merge folders.</p><h2 id="1-Merge-Folders-Using-File-Explorer"><a href="#1-Merge-Folders-Using-File-Explorer" class="headerlink" title="1. Merge Folders Using File Explorer"></a>1. Merge Folders Using File Explorer</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/confirm-folder-replace-merge-folder-file-explorer.jpg"                      alt="confirm folder replace merge folder file explorer"                ></p><p> File Explorer will detect and prompt you to merge the folder when you try to move a folder with a name identical to an existing folder at the same level.</p><p> For example, if you have an<strong>XYZ</strong> folder in<strong>D:\Folders</strong> and want to merge the<strong>XYX</strong> folder in the same level, all you have to do is rename the<strong>XYX</strong> folder as<strong>XYZ</strong> . When the<strong>Confirm Folder Replace</strong> prompt appears, click<strong>Yes</strong> .</p><p> Similarly, you can cut and paste the folder with identical names and then opt for the merge option. File Explorer will merge the folders and move the contents to the destination folder. If a duplicate file exists, you can opt for the<strong>Replace</strong> or<strong>Skip</strong> option.</p><p> Conversely, this can be a time-consuming process when you have to work with hundreds of folders at a time. A more efficient way to overcome this limitation is to use a PowerShell script hack to merge folders on Windows.</p><h2 id="2-Merge-Folders-Using-a-PowerShell-Script"><a href="#2-Merge-Folders-Using-a-PowerShell-Script" class="headerlink" title="2. Merge Folders Using a PowerShell Script"></a>2. Merge Folders Using a PowerShell Script</h2><p> PowerShell is a powerful automation shell utility. You can learn the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-powershell-commands-cmdlets/" >essential PowerShell cmdlets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to automate everyday tasks with a script.</p><p> Similarly, you can use a PowerShell script to merge folders in Windows 10 and 11. This is a handy way to merge multiple folders without copying and pasting them one by one.</p><p> To use the script, you must enable running scripts in Windows PowerShell. Once done, you can copy and paste the script directly onto the PowerShell window without having to run it as a .ps1 file.</p><p> To allow the local PowerShell script to Run, you’ll need to change the execution policy in the Settings app. Here’s how to do it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/enable-powershell-to-run-local-scripts.jpg"                      alt="enable powershell to run local scripts"                ></p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + I</strong> to open the<strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li>Next, open the<strong>Privacy &amp; security</strong> tab in the left pane.</li><li>Click on<strong>For Developer</strong> under the<strong>Security section</strong> .</li><li>Next, scroll down and click to expand the<strong>PowerShell</strong> section.</li><li>Toggle the switch to turn on <strong>Change execution policy to allow local PowerShell scripts to run without signing</strong> .<strong>Require signing for remote scripts</strong> .</li></ol><p> With the script running on PowerShell enabled, follow these to execute a PowerShell script to merge folders.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/merge-folders-powershell.jpg"                      alt="merge folders powershell"                ></p><ol><li>Press the<strong>Win</strong> key and type<strong>powershell</strong> .</li><li>Click on<strong>Windows PowerShell</strong> from the search results.</li><li>Copy and paste the following script in the PowerShell window:<br><code>$sourcePath = &quot;F:\New folder&quot;   $destinationPath = &quot;E:\New folder&quot;   $files = Get-ChildItem -Path $sourcePath -Recurse -Filter &quot;*.*&quot;   foreach($file in $files)&#123;       $sourcePathFile = $file.FullName       $destinationPathFile = $file.FullName.Replace($sourcePath, $destinationPath)       $exists = Test-Path $destinationPathFile       if(!$exists)&#123;           $dir = Split-Path -parent $destinationPathFile           if (!(Test-Path($dir))) &#123; New-Item -ItemType directory -Path $dir &#125;           Copy-Item -Path $sourcePathFile -Destination $destinationPathFile -Recurse -Force       &#125;       else&#123;           $isFile = Test-Path -Path $destinationPathFile -PathType Leaf           if(!$isFile)&#123;               Copy-Item -Path $sourcePathFile -Destination $destinationPathFile -Recurse -Force           &#125;       &#125;   &#125; </code></li><li>In the above command, replace “<strong>E:\New folder</strong> ” and “<strong>F:\New folder</strong> ” with the source and destination file paths, respectively. To find the file path, right-click on the folder name you want to merge and select<strong>Copy as the path.</strong></li><li>The above command will merge the contents of the<strong>E:\New folder</strong> with the<strong>F:\New folder</strong> . It will skip any duplicate file conflict to leave the original files in the destination folder unaffected.</li></ol><p> You can repeat the script with different file paths to merge more folders. If you encounter any error, check if the file path for the destination and source is correct.</p><h2 id="2-Merge-Folders-Using-Third-Party-Software"><a href="#2-Merge-Folders-Using-Third-Party-Software" class="headerlink" title="2.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Opera-Installer-Dilemma-on-Windows-Solutions-Now"><a href="#Opera-Installer-Dilemma-on-Windows-Solutions-Now" class="headerlink" title="Opera Installer Dilemma on Windows - Solutions Now"></a>Opera Installer Dilemma on Windows - Solutions Now</h2><p> Like many other software programs, Opera occasionally experiences technical problems. One common issue is when the installer gets stuck downloading on Windows systems.</p><p> It generally occurs for several reasons, such as network connectivity issues, incompatible system requirements, or a corrupted installer. This guide explores possible solutions, but before we get started, let’s investigate the reason for the problem.</p><h2 id="What-Stops-Opera-From-Installing"><a href="#What-Stops-Opera-From-Installing" class="headerlink" title="What Stops Opera From Installing?"></a>What Stops Opera From Installing?</h2><p> There are various reasons the Opera installer might get stuck during installation. These include:</p><ol><li><strong>Incompatible System Requirements:</strong> Opera may require specific system configurations or minimum hardware specifications. If your computer does not meet such requirements, the installation may fail.</li><li><strong>Corrupted or Incomplete Installer:</strong> If the Opera installer file is corrupted during download or incomplete, it can cause installation problems.</li><li><strong>Background Processes or Services:</strong> Background processes or services running on the system can interfere with installation. So, close unnecessary programs and services before installing Opera.</li><li><strong>Slow or Unstable Internet Connection:</strong> If your internet connection is weak or unstable, Opera Installer can get stuck during downloading. Make sure you have a stable and reliable internet connection before downloading Opera.</li><li><strong>Firewall or Antivirus Software:</strong> Security programs on your computer may block the download or mistakenly flag it as a potential threat. So, temporarily disable any firewall or antivirus software and try downloading Opera again.</li></ol><h2 id="1-Check-Your-Internet-Connection"><a href="#1-Check-Your-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="1. Check Your Internet Connection"></a>1. Check Your Internet Connection</h2><p> Slow and unstable connections can often cause Opera Installer to get stuck in a downloading state. Therefore, you should ensure that your internet connection is stable and working properly. You can try accessing other websites or downloading other files to confirm this. If the connection is weak or unstable, restart your router or switch to a different network.</p><p> You can also use <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/" >free speed-testing websites <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to check your internet speed. If you’re using a wireless connection, move closer to the router or connect with an Ethernet cable.</p><h2 id="2-Clear-Your-Temporary-Files"><a href="#2-Clear-Your-Temporary-Files" class="headerlink" title="2. Clear Your Temporary Files"></a>2. Clear Your Temporary Files</h2><p> Sometimes, temporary files stored on your computer can interfere with the downloading process. Clearing these files can fix the issue. Here’s how to do it:</p><ol><li>Press <strong>Win + R</strong> on your keyboard to open the Run command.</li><li>Type <strong>cmd</strong> in the text box and press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Enter</strong>.</li><li>If the UAC window appears, click <strong>Yes</strong> to grant permission.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/clear-the-temporary-files.jpg"                      alt="Clear the Temporary Files"                ></li><li>In the command window, type the following and press Enter.<br>del &#x2F;q&#x2F;f&#x2F;s %TEMP%*</li></ol><p> This will delete all the temporary files stored on your device. You may also want to check out some <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-delete-temporary-files/" >other methods for removing temporary files on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. After that, restart your computer and try downloading Opera again.</p><h2 id="3-Disable-the-Antivirus-and-Firewall-Programs"><a href="#3-Disable-the-Antivirus-and-Firewall-Programs" class="headerlink" title="3. Disable the Antivirus and Firewall Programs"></a>3. Disable the Antivirus and Firewall Programs</h2><p> Antivirus and firewall programs may disrupt the download process and prevent Opera from being installed. To fix this, you should temporarily disable these programs while downloading and installing Opera.</p><p> To disable the firewall, do the following.</p><ol><li>Click on Start and type <strong>Settings</strong> in the search bar</li><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong> from the results list</li><li>In the left-hand pane, click on the <strong>Privacy &amp; security</strong> tab.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/open-windows-security.jpg"                      alt="Open Windows Security"                ></li><li>On the right side, navigate to <strong>Windows Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Open Windows Security</strong>. This will open the Windows Security settings page</li><li>Click on <strong>Firewall &amp; network protection</strong> and select the appropriate profile</li><li>Click on the switch to turn off Microsoft Defender Firewall.</li></ol><p> After that, try downloading and installing Opera again.</p><h2 id="4-Close-Unnecessary-Programs-and-Services"><a href="#4-Close-Unnecessary-Programs-and-Services" class="headerlink" title="4. Close Unnecessary Programs and Services"></a>4. Close Unnecessary Programs and Services</h2><p> Too many programs and services running in the background could prevent Opera from installing. To fix this, close all unnecessary programs and services. Here’s how to do it.</p><p> First, press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</strong> on your keyboard. This will open the Task Manager.</p><p> From here, click on the <strong>Processes</strong> tab and select any programs or services that are taking up too much of your system resources. Click on <strong>End task</strong> and try downloading Opera again.</p><h2 id="5-Check-the-System-Requirements"><a href="#5-Check-the-System-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="5. Check the System Requirements"></a>5. Check the System Requirements</h2><p> Some older computers may not meet the system requirements for installing Opera. So, you must check that your device meets the minimum system requirements before downloading the installer</p><p> The system requirements are pretty basic to run Opera on Windows computers.</p><p> To get started, your computer must have at least an <strong>Intel Pentium 4</strong> or <strong>AMD Athlon 64</strong> processor. It needs <strong>512MB</strong> of RAM and storage in the form of a Hard Disk Drive or other removable media. Finally, it requires a <strong>Super VGA</strong> (640x480) or higher resolution video adapter to display the browser properly.</p><p> If your computer doesn’t meet these specs, the installer might stop because your computer isn’t compatible. In this case, upgrade your hardware or switch to a different browser.</p><h2 id="6-Disable-VPN-or-Proxy-Settings"><a href="#6-Disable-VPN-or-Proxy-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6. Disable VPN or Proxy Settings"></a>6. Disable VPN or Proxy Settings</h2><p> VPNs or proxy servers sometimes cause download issues. So, if you’re using a proxy or VPN connection, temporarily disable it and try downloading Opera again.</p><p> To disable the proxy setting, open the Settings menu. Select <strong>Network &amp; internet</strong> in the left pane, then click <strong>Proxy</strong> on the right side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/manual-proxy-setup.jpg"                      alt="Manual Proxy Setup"                ></p><p> In the Proxy settings, you will see a section called <strong>Manual proxy setup</strong>. Click <strong>Setup</strong> next to Use a proxy server. Make sure the toggle switch labeled <strong>Use a proxy server</strong> is set to the off position. If it’s already off, the proxy isn’t enabled, and nothing needs to be changed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/edit-proxy-server.jpg"                      alt="Edit Proxy Server"                ></p><p> Additionally, you can disable the <strong>Automatically detect settings</strong> toggle switch, so Windows won’t use a proxy server when it detects your network settings.</p><p> Once you disable the proxy server, disable your VPN connection next. To do this, open the <strong>Network &amp; internet</strong> page again. Select <strong>VPN</strong> on the right-hand side. You should see a list of VPNs currently connected to your device.</p><p> Select the VPN connection you want to disable, then click the <strong>Disconnect</strong> button. This will disable your VPN connection, and you can try downloading Opera again.</p><h2 id="7-Download-the-Opera-Offline-Installer"><a href="#7-Download-the-Opera-Offline-Installer" class="headerlink" title="7. Download the Opera Offline Installer"></a>7. Download the Opera Offline Installer</h2><p> The issue may be due to your internet connection being prone to outages. To fix this, download the offline installer rather than the online one. The offline installer has all the necessary files bundled together and can be installed without an internet connection.</p><p> You can download the offline installer from the official Opera website. Here’s how to do it.</p><ol><li>Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://www.opera.com/download" >official Opera website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and click on <strong>Downloads</strong>.</li><li>Scroll down to the <strong>Opera</strong> section and expand it.</li><li>Select the Standalone installer and click on <strong>Download now</strong>.</li><li>Upon downloading, open Windows File Explorer and navigate to <strong>Downloads</strong>.</li><li>Double-click on the setup file and follow the screen instructions to install Opera.</li></ol><p> Once you complete the above steps, the browser should work normally.</p><h2 id="Get-Opera-for-Windows-Installed-Successfully"><a href="#Get-Opera-for-Windows-Installed-Successfully" class="headerlink" title="Get Opera for Windows Installed Successfully"></a>Get Opera for Windows Installed Successfully</h2><p> Unlike Chrome and Edge, Opera is a free browser that offers a comprehensive web experience. Although the installation process may be complex, these solutions simplify it. Install Opera easily on your computer with these helpful tips.</p><p> It generally occurs for several reasons, such as network connectivity issues, incompatible system requirements, or a corrupted installer.

Once that’s decided, move on to the next step.</p><h2 id="2-What-Do-You-Plan-on-Using-Your-Windows-Laptop-For"><a href="#2-What-Do-You-Plan-on-Using-Your-Windows-Laptop-For" class="headerlink" title="2. What Do You Plan on Using Your Windows Laptop For?"></a>2. What Do You Plan on Using Your Windows Laptop For?</h2><p> Following the budget decision, ask yourself what you intend to use the laptop for. Do you want a laptop for your business, work, or school? Do you want a laptop for specific needs, such as gaming, graphic design, etc., or want to get yourself a multipurpose device you can use for many tasks?</p><p> Your purchase objective also impacts other factors you need to consider in the next steps, such as the device’s battery life, hardware specifications, how portable it should be, the brand you choose, etc. Therefore, carefully brainstorm your needs and determine what you plan to do with your laptop.</p><p> This step also decides which apps you’ll want on your PC on day one. For example, will your laptop be useless to you if it doesn’t have a word processor on it? If so, it might be worth looking into deals where Office is pre-installed, or comes with a few months of Office 365 bundled in with the cost.</p><p> A clear definition of your needs may eliminate the necessity to purchase a laptop if you see <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-reasons-dont-need-laptop-anymore/" >some reasons you may not need a laptop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Instead, you may opt for another device.</p><h2 id="3-Which-Hardware-Specifications-Are-Most-Important-to-You"><a href="#3-Which-Hardware-Specifications-Are-Most-Important-to-You" class="headerlink" title="3. Which Hardware Specifications Are Most Important to You?"></a>3. Which Hardware Specifications Are Most Important to You?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AMD-vs-Intel.jpg"                      alt="AMD processor and Intel processor side by side"                ></p><p> Once you’ve determined your purpose for buying a laptop, you should analyze how powerful its hardware should be to meet your needs. Is there a specific purpose you hope your laptop will serve? If that is the case, you may need to prioritize some hardware components over others for your system to run efficiently.</p><p> For instance, if you’re buying a gaming laptop or plan to do graphics-intensive work on it, be sure that the GPU is powerful enough to handle the workload. Likewise, buying a laptop for work or studies does not necessarily require a GPU but rather a more powerful RAM and processor. Based on that, list the specs your device needs to perform at its best.</p><p> Check our guides on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/programmer-things-to-consider-buying-laptop/" >what to consider when choosing a laptop as a programmer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/specs-check-before-buying-laptop-school/" >student <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to buy a device for these purposes.</p><h2 id="4-How-Long-Do-You-Need-the-Laptop-Battery-to-Last-on-a-Single-Charge"><a href="#4-How-Long-Do-You-Need-the-Laptop-Battery-to-Last-on-a-Single-Charge" class="headerlink" title="4. How Long Do You Need the Laptop Battery to Last on a Single Charge?"></a>4. How Long Do You Need the Laptop Battery to Last on a Single Charge?</h2><p> Even the best laptop in the world cannot serve its purpose if its battery doesn’t last long and dies at the worst possible moment. Having taken into account the first three factors, you should ask yourself how long the laptop should last on a single charge so that you won’t have to recharge it frequently.</p><p> In cases where you cannot leave the device tethered to the power source for long, such as when traveling, you should aim for a device that can last an entire day on a single charge. In contrast, battery life shouldn’t be a concern if you plan to use the device mostly at your desk, such as at work or for gaming, where you can tether it every time you use it.</p><p> Nevertheless, ensure the battery lasts at least long enough to get you through a power outage or an outdoor excursion.</p><h2 id="5-What-Size-and-Weight-of-the-Laptop-Is-Most-Suitable-for-Your-Needs"><a href="#5-What-Size-and-Weight-of-the-Laptop-Is-Most-Suitable-for-Your-Needs" class="headerlink" title="5. What Size and Weight of the Laptop Is Most Suitable for Your Needs?"></a>5. What Size and Weight of the Laptop Is Most Suitable for Your Needs?</h2><p> Portability is another factor to consider when purchasing a laptop. The lighter and more compact a laptop is, the easier it will be to move around. In case you are always on the go carrying your laptop in your bag, you should get a lightweight and compact laptop that fits easily into your backpack.</p><p> Specific-purpose laptops, such as gaming machines, are usually heavier and have wider displays, making them bulkier and harder to move around. Therefore, considering the impact portability could have on how you use the laptop, consider the size and weight before locking your purchase.</p><h2 id="6-Which-Brand-Should-You-Choose-and-What-Warranty-Options-Are-Available"><a href="#6-Which-Brand-Should-You-Choose-and-What-Warranty-Options-Are-Available" class="headerlink" title="6. Which Brand Should You Choose, and What Warranty Options Are Available?"></a>6. Which Brand Should You Choose, and What Warranty Options Are Available?</h2><p> Laptop brands cater to the needs of different audiences with their laptops. However, not all manufacturers specialize in every category; each one is known for making the best laptops for a particular purpose. For instance, Acer, Asus, MSI, and Gigabyte gaming laptops are given competitive advantages over their competitors.</p><p> Thus, based on what you need the laptop for, determine which brand specializes in designing laptops for that category and select the brand accordingly.</p><p> Besides that, you should consider how reliable the warranty options the brand offers are. By choosing a laptop with a good warranty, you can feel confident that your money is well spent, and you won’t have to deal with independent repair shops if your laptop breaks down. Ensure the laptop you buy has at least a year or two warranty.</p><h2 id="7-What-Type-and-Number-of-Ports-Would-You-Need-on-Your-Laptop"><a href="#7-What-Type-and-Number-of-Ports-Would-You-Need-on-Your-Laptop" class="headerlink" title="7.

Ethernet, HDMI, and USB Type-C ports are some of the ports you definitely need on your laptop. So, if your use case requires these ports, choose a laptop that has them.</p><p> Obviously, you can always purchase external adapters to connect devices in ports your device does not support; however, that will add to the cost and take up space on your desk.</p><h2 id="Mastering-Your-Windows-Laptop-Purchase"><a href="#Mastering-Your-Windows-Laptop-Purchase" class="headerlink" title="Mastering Your Windows Laptop Purchase"></a>Mastering Your Windows Laptop Purchase</h2><p> The decision to buy a laptop isn’t one you make every day. By now, you should better understand what to look for in a laptop that perfectly meets your needs. By listing your requirements after answering the above questions, you will be able to filter out the suitable device better and make a well-informed decision.</p><p> The purchase of a new laptop isn’t always a one-off purchase; in fact, you need to buy additional accessories to maximize its potential.</p><p> To make it easier for you to define your needs and requirements, we’ve compiled a list of questions you should ask yourself while searching for the perfect Windows laptop.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/beginners-tutorial-on-windows-canary-usage/"><u>Beginner’s Tutorial on Windows Canary Usage</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/eradicate-error-e1-in-windows-10-11-editions/"><u>Eradicate Error E1 in Windows 10, 11 Editions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/get-to-safety-six-steps-to-entering-safe-mode-in-windows-11/"><u>Get to Safety: Six Steps to Entering Safe Mode in Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/boost-mouse-click-agility-nine-strategies-to-tweak-speeds/"><u>Boost Mouse Click Agility: Nine Strategies to Tweak Speeds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/avoid-decreased-size-of-your-windows-11-icons/"><u>Avoid Decreased Size of Your Windows 11 Icons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/reboot-to-reconnect-reviving-ethernet-net-access/"><u>Reboot to Reconnect: Reviving Ethernet Net Access</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/guide-controlling-windows-11s-content-filter/"><u>Guide: Controlling Windows 11’S Content Filter</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-makeup-maverick-innovative-looks-and-techniques-unveiled/"><u>[Updated] Makeup Maverick  Innovative Looks & Techniques Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-use-life360-on-windows-pc-for-xiaomi-civi-3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Use Life360 on Windows PC For Xiaomi Civi 3? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-dominating-the-digital-realm-youtube-marketing-secrets/"><u>In 2024, Dominating the Digital Realm  YouTube Marketing Secrets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-be-bold-on-igtv-the-10-cutting-edge-video-concepts-for-your-brand/"><u>2024 Approved  Be Bold on IGTV  The 10 Cutting-Edge Video Concepts for Your Brand</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-from-wardrobe-to-webcam-your-macootd-tiktok-adventure-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] From Wardrobe to Webcam  Your MacOOTD TikTok Adventure for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/avoiding-pitfalls-in-angled-and-merged-video-manipulation-android-for-2024/"><u>Avoiding Pitfalls in Angled & Merged Video Manipulation (Android) for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-ai-editor.techidaily.com/2024-approved-video-success-on-linkedin-the-ultimate-aspect-ratio-guide/"><u>2024 Approved Video Success on LinkedIn The Ultimate Aspect Ratio Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/the-5-best-ways-to-make-money-on-youtube-shorts-today-for-2024/"><u>The 5 Best Ways to Make Money on YouTube Shorts Today for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

If so, you can easily do this if the partitions you want to merge are adjacent; if they are not adjacent, the process would be more complicated. This begs the question: how do adjacent and nonadjacent partitions differ?</p><p> Below, we’ll show you how to merge adjacent and non-adjacent partitions using Device Management and NIUBI Partition Editor, a third-party app.</p><h2 id="How-Do-Adjacent-and-Non-Adjacent-Partitions-Differ"><a href="#How-Do-Adjacent-and-Non-Adjacent-Partitions-Differ" class="headerlink" title="How Do Adjacent and Non-Adjacent Partitions Differ?"></a>How Do Adjacent and Non-Adjacent Partitions Differ?</h2><p> As the name implies, adjacent partitions are located next to each other. If you have two drives right next to each other, C and D, they are considered adjacent partitions. In contrast, if you have three partitions, C, D, and E, then C and E are nonadjacent partitions because drive D separates them.</p><p> It’s straightforward to merge adjacent partitions using the Windows built-in tool and any third-party app. However, merging two non-adjacent partitions could be complicated.</p><h2 id="How-to-Merge-Adjacent-Partitions-Using-Windows-Disk-Management"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Adjacent-Partitions-Using-Windows-Disk-Management" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Adjacent Partitions Using Windows Disk Management"></a>How to Merge Adjacent Partitions Using Windows Disk Management</h2><p> Disk Management is a Windows built-in utility that allows us to manage the hard drives installed on our device. The tool enables us to create, format, and delete partitions, shrink the drive volume by creating a new partition, expand the drive volume by merging space from another drive, and much more.</p><p> When merging a partition with the Disk Management tool, it is necessary to delete an existing volume (adjacent to the drive you wish to extend) and release some space first. Later, you can merge this unallocated space into a partition of your choice.</p><p> Therefore, you’ll lose all your data on the drive you want to merge (or delete), which is a major disadvantage. Because of that, you’ll need to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/move-installed-apps-programs-windows-10/" >relocate your essential Windows apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and files from that drive, and then delete the volume.</p><p> Let’s say you want to merge drive D with drive C. This will require you to delete drive D first and merge it into drive C after that. You can delete the volume by following these steps:</p><ol><li>Type <strong>“Create and format”</strong> in the Windows Search box and click <strong>Create and format hard disk partitions</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/1-type-create-and-format-in-windows-search-to-open-the-disk-management-utility.jpg"                      alt="Type Create and Format in Windows Search to Open the Disk Management Utility"                ></li><li>Right-click the volume (the drive you want to merge into another) and select <strong>Delete Volume</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2-delete-volume-d-from-windows-disk-management-tool.jpg"                      alt="Delete Volume D From Windows Disk Management Tool"                ></li></ol><p> Once you’ve got enough unallocated space available, follow these steps to merge it into your preferred drive:</p><ol><li>Right-click the drive you want to extend and select <strong>Extend Volume</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3-right-click-the-drive-you-want-to-extend-and-select-extend-volume-in-the-windows-disk-management-tool.jpg"                      alt="Right-Click the Drive You Want to Extend and select Extend Volume in the Windows Disk Management Tool"                ></li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>, then select the amount of space you want to merge in the box next to <strong>Select the amount of space in MB</strong>.

You need to first delete the volumes between your destination drive and unallocated space.</p><p> Deleting the in-between volumes will increase the unallocated space and it’ll become adjacent to your destination drive. Later, you can merge some portion of the unallocated space into the destination drive and use the rest to recreate the in-between volumes you deleted earlier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/6-delete-the-volumes-between-your-destination-drive-and-unallocated-space-in-windows-disk-management-tool.jpg"                      alt="Delete the Volumes Between Your Destination Drive and Unallocated Space in Windows Disk Management Tool"                ></p><p> Because deleting a volume also deletes its data, you have to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-complete-backup/" >create a backup of all drives <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> en route to your destination and unallocated space before deleting them. Because of this, merging nonadjacent partitions using Device Management is considered ineffective and time-consuming. An easy way to avoid this hassle is to use third-party tools.</p><h2 id="How-to-Merge-Two-Non-Adjacent-Partitions-Using-NIUBI-Partition-Editor"><a href="#How-to-Merge-Two-Non-Adjacent-Partitions-Using-NIUBI-Partition-Editor" class="headerlink" title="How to Merge Two Non-Adjacent Partitions Using NIUBI Partition Editor"></a>How to Merge Two Non-Adjacent Partitions Using NIUBI Partition Editor</h2><p> NIUBI Partition Editor makes merging nonadjacent partitions easy and doesn’t require you to delete partitions between the unallocated space and destination partition. Here’s how you can merge two non-adjacent partitions, say C and E, using NIUBI:</p><ol><li>Download the NIUBI Partition Editor software from the <a class="link"   href="https://www.hdd-tool.com/download.html" >HDD-Tool official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. There are two ways to use the software: download and install the setup file or download the portable version and use it without installing it.</li><li>Search for <strong>NIUBI</strong> in Windows Search to open the software.</li><li>Right-click the <strong>E</strong> drive you want to merge into <strong>C</strong> and click <strong>Delete volume</strong>. Click <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm; this will release the space.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/8-delete-volume-e-in-niubi-partition-editor.jpg"                      alt="Delete Volume E in NIUBI Partition Editor"                ></li><li>Now, right-click on partition <strong>D,</strong> which is between partition <strong>C</strong> and unallocated space, and click <strong>Resize&#x2F;Move volume</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/9-click-on-resizemode-to-relocate-the-partition-d-in-niubi-partition-editor.jpg"                      alt="Click on ResizeMode to Relocate the Partition D in NIUBI Partition Editor"                ></li><li>Then, move the whole volume (don’t extend the volume) to the unallocated space right next to it, which will move drive <strong>D</strong> to where the unallocated space was, making the unallocated space adjacent to drive <strong>C</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10-drag-the-drive-d-towards-the-unallocated-space-to-make-the-free-space-adjacent-to-the-drive-c.jpg"                      alt="Drag the Drive D towards the Unallocated Space to Make the Free Space Adjacent to the Drive C"                ></li><li>Once adjacent, right-click the <strong>C</strong> drive, click <strong>Resize&#x2F;Move Volume</strong>, then expand the <strong>C</strong> drive’s space to cover the unallocated space.

They either find these options grayed out or missing altogether. It usually happens when you try to move or resize an encrypted drive.</p><p> If you see either of these options missing or grayed out for a specific drive, you should first remove the drive encryption, which is Bitlocker by default in Windows. While you can turn off encryption from individual partitions in different ways, we recommend turning off encryption at the device level for a short period of time. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Search for <strong>“Device Encryption”</strong> in the Windows Search and click on <strong>Device encryption settings</strong>.</li><li>Turn the toggle next to <strong>Device encryption</strong> off.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/12-turn-the-device-encryption-off-in-windows-device-encryption-settings-in-windows-settings-app.jpg"                      alt="Turn the Device Encryption Off in Windows Device Encryption Settings in Windows Settings App"                ></li></ol><p> Turning off encryption can take a long time, so be patient while the process finishes, and you see the toggle next to <strong>Device encryption</strong> turned off. Once that’s done, you can resize and move all the drives without restrictions. Once you’re done merging the partitions, re-enable the device encryption.</p><h2 id="Merge-Partitions-With-Ease-on-Windows"><a href="#Merge-Partitions-With-Ease-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Merge Partitions With Ease on Windows"></a>Merge Partitions With Ease on Windows</h2><p> You can merge partitions to use free space better or expand the volume of a drive running low on storage. Hopefully, you’ll now be able to merge adjacent and non-adjacent partitions more easily. Don’t forget to turn off device encryption if you cannot resize the drive.</p><p> Also, it is not necessary to use NIUBI Partition Editor; you can use any disk management software of your choice.</p><p> Below, we’ll show you how to merge adjacent and non-adjacent partitions using Device Management and NIUBI Partition Editor, a third-party app.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/10-ways-to-clean-up-your-firewall-rules/"><u>10 Ways to Clean Up Your Firewall Rules</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/mindfulness-meets-the-mind-cognitive-and-emotional-responses-to-meditation/"><u>Mindfulness Meets the Mind: Cognitive & Emotional Responses to Meditation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/addressing-gaps-in-time-remaining-estimates-of-windows-11-laptops/"><u>Addressing Gaps in Time Remaining Estimates of Windows 11 Laptops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-student-laptop-asus-s15-oled-in-focus/"><u>The Ultimate Student Laptop: ASUS S15 OLED in Focus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/advance-windows-11-task-manager-refresh-speeds/"><u>Advance Windows 11 Task Manager Refresh Speeds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/quick-shift-script-moving-windows-11-selected-files/"><u>Quick Shift Script: Moving Windows 11 Selected Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/how-to-sweep-away-delayed-input-fasten-your-fingers-for-windows-11/"><u>How to Sweep Away Delayed Input: Fasten Your Fingers for Windows 11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/adjusting-win11-taskbar-icon-dimensions/"><u>Adjusting Win11 Taskbar Icon Dimensions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-erase-an-iphone-15-pro-without-apple-id-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Erase an iPhone 15 Pro without Apple ID?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/how-to-quickly-fix-bluetooth-not-working-on-motorola-razr-40-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How to Quickly Fix Bluetooth Not Working on Motorola Razr 40 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-realme-10t-5g-location-by-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Track Realme 10T 5G Location by Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-voicing-the-future-the-top-8-free-online-recorders-transforming-audio/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Voicing the Future The Top 8 Free, Online Recorders Transforming Audio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/pokemon-go-error-12-failed-to-detect-location-on-honor-100-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Pokemon Go Error 12 Failed to Detect Location On Honor 100? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://network-issues.techidaily.com/display-system-reactivated-post-failure/"><u>Display System Reactivated Post-Failure</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-hdmi-legacy-package/"><u>[New] In 2024, HDMI Legacy Package</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-no-fluff-just-facts-the-verdict-on-recordcast/"><u>[New] No Fluff, Just Facts  The Verdict on RecordCast</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-a-network-locked-tecno-pova-6-pro-5g-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock a Network Locked Tecno Pova 6 Pro 5G Phone?</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

It also keeps you up to date with your most recent emails by sending you timely notification alerts. However, when those notifications stop working, you could miss out on important or urgent mail.</p><p> If this happens to you, here are some effective troubleshooting tips that will help you fix the problem.</p><h2 id="1-Check-the-In-App-Notification-Settings"><a href="#1-Check-the-In-App-Notification-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1. Check the In-App Notification Settings"></a>1. Check the In-App Notification Settings</h2><p> Your first step is to make sure that you haven’t turned off notifications from the Mail app.</p><p>To access notification settings in the Mail app:</p><ol><li>Open the Mail app on your PC.</li><li>Click on the<strong>Settings icon</strong> in the bottom left corner.</li><li>Select<strong>Notifications</strong> from the menu that appears on your right.</li><li>Use the drop-down menu to select your account or check the box that reads<strong>Apply to all accounts</strong> .</li><li>Enable the toggle for<strong>Show notifications in the action center</strong> .</li><li>Tick the<strong>Show a notification banner</strong> checkbox.</li><li>Tick the<strong>Play a sound</strong> checkbox.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Enable-Windows-Mail-Notifications.jpg"                      alt="Enable Windows Mail Notifications"                ></li></ol><p> Once you complete the above steps, the Mail app should start showing notifications on Windows.</p><h2 id="2-Enable-Mail-App-Notifications-From-Windows-Settings"><a href="#2-Enable-Mail-App-Notifications-From-Windows-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Enable Mail App Notifications From Windows Settings"></a>2. Enable Mail App Notifications From Windows Settings</h2><p> Windows includes numerous notification management options, including the ability to enable or disable notifications for specific apps. If you’ve previously learned <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-customize-notifications/" >how to customize your notifications on Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and turned off notifications for the Mail app, you won’t get any alerts.</p><p> To enable Mail app notifications from Windows Settings, do the following:</p><ol><li>Open the<strong>Start menu</strong> and click the<strong>gear-shaped icon</strong> to launch the Settings app.</li><li>In the<strong>System</strong> tab, click on<strong>Notifications</strong> .</li><li>Under<strong>Notifications from apps and other senders</strong> , enable the switch next to<strong>Mail</strong> if it isn’t already.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Enable-Windows-Mail-App-Notifications.jpg"                      alt="Enable Windows Mail App Notifications"                ></li></ol><h2 id="3-Check-Mailbox-Sync-Settings"><a href="#3-Check-Mailbox-Sync-Settings" class="headerlink" title="3. Check Mailbox Sync Settings"></a>3. Check Mailbox Sync Settings</h2><p> You can configure the Mail app sync settings to specify how frequently the app should connect to the server to download new content. If Mail app notifications are arriving late, you can resolve the problem by modifying the mailbox sync settings. Here’s what you’ll need to do.</p><ol><li>Open the Mail app using the search menu.</li><li>Click the<strong>gear icon</strong> in the bottom left corner to open app settings.</li><li>Select<strong>Manage accounts</strong> from the menu that appears on your right.</li><li>Select your email account.</li><li>Click on<strong>Change mailbox sync settings</strong> .</li><li>Under<strong>Download new content</strong> , select<strong>as items arrive</strong> .</li><li>Under<strong>Sync options</strong> , enable the toggle for<strong>Email</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Check-Mail-App-Sync-Settings-Windows.jpg"                      alt="Check Mail App Sync Settings Windows"                ></li></ol><h2 id="4-Allow-the-Mail-App-to-Run-in-the-Background"><a href="#4-Allow-the-Mail-App-to-Run-in-the-Background" class="headerlink" title="4. Allow the Mail App to Run in the Background"></a>4. Allow the Mail App to Run in the Background</h2><p> Windows lets you decide which apps and programs can run in the background. If you have denied the Mail app permission to run in the background, you will not receive notifications unless the app is open.</p><p> To fix this, you must allow background app permissions to the Mail app by following the steps below.</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + I</strong> to open the Settings app.</li><li>Use the left pane to navigate to the<strong>Apps</strong> tab.</li><li>Click on<strong>Installed apps</strong> .</li><li>Scroll down or use the search bar at the top to locate the Mail app on the list.</li><li>Click the<strong>three-dot menu icon</strong> next to the app and select<strong>Advanced options</strong> .</li><li>Click the drop-down menu under<strong>Background apps permissions</strong> and choose<strong>Always</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Allow-Windows-Mail-App-to-Run-in-the-Background.jpg"                      alt="Allow Windows Mail App to Run in the Background"                ></li></ol><h2 id="5-Remove-and-Re-Add-Your-Email-Account"><a href="#5-Remove-and-Re-Add-Your-Email-Account" class="headerlink" title="5. Remove and Re-Add Your Email Account"></a>5. Remove and Re-Add Your Email Account</h2><p> If the Mail app still fails to show notifications, you can try removing your email account from the app and adding it again. This should reconnect your account to the app and resolve any issues.</p><ol><li>Open the Mail app on your PC and click the<strong>settings icon</strong> .</li><li>Click on<strong>Manage accounts</strong> and select the account you want to remove.</li><li>Select<strong>Delete account from this device</strong> .</li><li>Choose<strong>Delete</strong> to confirm.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Delete-Account-From-the-Windows-Mail-App.jpg"                      alt="Delete Account From the Windows Mail App"                ></li></ol><p>Once removed, restart the Mail app and add your account again.</p><h2 id="6-Turn-Off-Focus-Assist"><a href="#6-Turn-Off-Focus-Assist" class="headerlink" title="6. Turn Off Focus Assist"></a>6. Turn Off Focus Assist</h2><p> Focus Assist is a handy Windows feature that mutes notifications for all apps unless specified otherwise. If you’ve enabled this feature, you will not receive notifications from any apps, including the Mail app.</p><p> You must disable Focus Assist to start receiving notifications again. Here’s how to do it.</p><ol><li>Open the<strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li>Navigate to<strong>System &gt; Focus</strong> .</li><li>Set the Focus Assist to<strong>Off</strong> , so you get all notifications.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Turn-Off-Focus-Assist.jpg"                      alt="Turn Off Focus Assist"                ></li></ol><p> Further, check the<strong>Automatic rules</strong> section to make sure Focus Assist is not set to enable itself automatically.</p><p> If you’re interested in Focus Assist, be sure to check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-focus-assist/" >how to silence notifications in Focus Assist for Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="7-Disable-Battery-Saver-Mode"><a href="#7-Disable-Battery-Saver-Mode" class="headerlink" title="7. Disable Battery Saver Mode"></a>7. Disable Battery Saver Mode</h2><p> When you enable battery saver mode, Windows limits various background app activities in order to extend battery life. This can prevent apps like Mail from syncing in the background and displaying notifications. To avoid this, you should disable battery saver mode on Windows. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + I</strong> to open the Settings app.</li><li>Navigate to<strong>System &gt; Power &amp; battery</strong> .</li><li>Click on<strong>Battery saver</strong> to expand it.</li><li>Click the<strong>Turn off now</strong> button.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Turn-Off-Battery-Saver-on-Windows.jpg"                      alt="Turn Off Battery Saver on Windows"                ></li></ol><h2 id="8-Repair-or-Reset-the-Mail-App"><a href="#8-Repair-or-Reset-the-Mail-App" class="headerlink" title="8. Repair or Reset the Mail App"></a>8. Repair or Reset the Mail App</h2><p> If the Mail app is still failing to display notifications on Windows, you can try repairing the app. For that, you’ll need to use the Windows Settings app. Here are the steps you can follow.</p><ol><li>Right-click on the<strong>Start icon</strong> or press<strong>Win + X</strong> to open the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-power-menu-guide/" >Power Menu <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Select<strong>Installed apps</strong> from the menu.</li><li>Scroll down to locate the Mail app on the list.</li><li>Click the<strong>three-dot menu icon</strong> next to the app and select<strong>Advanced options</strong> .</li><li>Scroll down to the<strong>Reset</strong> section and click on<strong>Repair</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Repair-or-Reset-Windows-Mail-App.jpg"                      alt="Repair or Reset Windows Mail App"                ></li></ol><p> Windows will attempt to repair the app. You should see a checkmark next to the Repair button once the process is complete. If the problem persists, you can try resetting the app instead. Note that this process will delete all the app data.</p><h2 id="9-Update-the-Mail-App"><a href="#9-Update-the-Mail-App" class="headerlink" title="9. Update the Mail App"></a>9. Update the Mail App</h2><p> If you don’t update your apps on a regular basis, they will get outdated eventually. It’s possible that the Mail app notifications aren’t working because of a faulty app version. If that’s the case, updating the app will help more often than not.</p><p> Head over to the Microsoft Store on your PC. Search for<strong>Mail and calendar</strong> app and click the<strong>Update</strong> button. If you do not see the Update option, then the app is already up-to-date.</p><h2 id="Fixing-Mail-App-Notifications-on-Windows"><a href="#Fixing-Mail-App-Notifications-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Fixing Mail App Notifications on Windows"></a>Fixing Mail App Notifications on Windows</h2><p> The Mail app notification issues can occur due to various factors, ranging from incorrectly configured settings to a faulty app update. In any case, going through the above-mentioned fixes should get the Mail app notifications to work again on Windows.</p><p> If you’ve gotten tired of such issues with the default Windows Mail app, there are plenty of third-party email apps you may want to try.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/create-a-convenient-windows-environment-portable-software-icons/"><u>Create a Convenient Windows Environment: Portable Software Icons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/secrets-to-savings-on-windows-10-key-focused-strategies/"><u>Secrets to Savings on Windows 10: Key-Focused Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/steps-for-stopping-auto-recommended-game-suggestion/"><u>Steps for Stopping Auto-Recommended Game Suggestion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/audio-capture-while-screen-recording-with-snipping-tool-max-156/"><u>Audio Capture While Screen Recording with Snipping Tool (Max 156)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/easing-windows-woes-with-adobe-ps/"><u>Easing Windows Woes with Adobe PS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/a-guide-to-understanding-windows-program-files-format/"><u>A Guide to Understanding Windows' Program Files Format</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/efficient-performance-gauges-for-pcs/"><u>Efficient Performance Gauges for PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/1719208597283-unravel-complex-windows-issues-help-at-hand/"><u>Unravel Complex Windows Issues: Help at Hand</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/windows-11s-evolution-unveiling-the-latest-system-updates/"><u>Windows 11'S Evolution: Unveiling the Latest System Updates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-silent-sounds-on-windows-devices/"><u>Troubleshooting Silent Sounds on Windows Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/detailed-guide-of-ispoofer-for-pogo-installation-on-oneplus-nord-n30-se-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Detailed guide of ispoofer for pogo installation On OnePlus Nord N30 SE | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/ultimate-budget-savvy-white-computing-solutions/"><u>Ultimate Budget-Savvy White Computing Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-constructing-premium-canon-chrono-images/"><u>[New] Constructing Premium Canon Chrono Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-timeless-tunes-collection-perfect-pairings-of-classical-music-for-modern-wedding-films/"><u>New 2024 Approved Timeless Tunes Collection Perfect Pairings of Classical Music for Modern Wedding Films</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-decoding-the-mystery-of-where-are-my-youtube-comments-in-2024/"><u>[Updated] Decoding the Mystery of Where Are My YouTube Comments, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-playful-media-extractor-evaluation/"><u>2024 Approved  Playful Media Extractor Evaluation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/elegant-departures-from-zero-costs-to-paid-options/"><u>Elegant Departures  From Zero Costs to Paid Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-list-of-whatsapp-status-maker-apps-for-2024/"><u>Updated The Ultimate List of WhatsApp Status Maker Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-achieving-asmr-bliss-selecting-the-right-mic/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Achieving ASMR Bliss  Selecting the Right Mic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-screen-recording-on-macos-ahead-with-bandicam-or-camtasia/"><u>2024 Approved  Screen Recording on MacOS  Ahead with Bandicam or Camtasia?</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Most of the time, it happens when you fill in the CAPTCHA incorrectly, and it considers you a robot, so it throws an error telling you to fill it out again.</p><p> However, there are times when Steam throws this error even when the CAPTCHA is correctly filled out. Why does this happen? In this article, we’ll look at the reasons behind this error and what you can do to fix it.</p><h2 id="What-Causes-the-“Your-Response-to-the-CAPTCHA-Appears-to-Be-Invalid”-Error-on-Steam"><a href="#What-Causes-the-“Your-Response-to-the-CAPTCHA-Appears-to-Be-Invalid”-Error-on-Steam" class="headerlink" title="What Causes the “Your Response to the CAPTCHA Appears to Be Invalid” Error on Steam?"></a>What Causes the “Your Response to the CAPTCHA Appears to Be Invalid” Error on Steam?</h2><p> Steam displays the error “Your response to the CAPTCHA appears to be invalid. Please re-verify that you’re not a robot below” when you enter the CAPTCHA incorrectly. Other causes could include a problem with the internet connection, an IP blockage, or an issue with the browser or DNS cache. If you’re experiencing this issue, here are some fixes you can apply.</p><h2 id="But-First-Some-Preliminary-Fixes-for-Steam’s-CAPTCHA-Issues"><a href="#But-First-Some-Preliminary-Fixes-for-Steam’s-CAPTCHA-Issues" class="headerlink" title="But First, Some Preliminary Fixes for Steam’s CAPTCHA Issues"></a>But First, Some Preliminary Fixes for Steam’s CAPTCHA Issues</h2><p> Before rolling up your sleeves and starting the troubleshooting, try these fixes:</p><ul><li>Fill out the CAPTCHA correctly. Be sure to get a second opinion from someone else to ensure you’re not making a mistake.</li><li>Fill out the CAPTCHA again after refreshing the Steam sign-up webpage you’re having issues with.</li><li>Try signing up again after closing the Steam sign-up page.</li><li>Restart your browser to rule out temporary glitches.</li><li>Switch your browser to ensure the problem isn’t with your browser.</li><li>Restart your router to clean its short-term memory (cache).</li><li>Disable any auto-CAPTCHA solver you have installed or enabled on your computer.</li><li>Select the correct country of residence on the sign-up page.</li></ul><p> If the preliminary checks do not resolve the issue, proceed with applying the remaining fixes.</p><h2 id="1-Rule-Out-Internet-Issues"><a href="#1-Rule-Out-Internet-Issues" class="headerlink" title="1. Rule Out Internet Issues"></a>1. Rule Out Internet Issues</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/modern-wifi-router.jpg"                      alt="modern wifi router placed on a table"                ></p><p> A CAPTCHA requires an active internet connection to verify that the request is made by a human and not a robot. If your internet connection goes down during the CAPTCHA verification process, you may have problems filling in the CAPTCHA. Thus, make sure your internet is working before anything else.</p><p> Check your internet connection by searching for anything else on the browser and see if it works. If the issue is with the internet, you need to fix your internet issues (see <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-simple-steps-diagnose-network-problem/" >home network diagnostic tricks and fixes you can try <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>) before moving forward. Nonetheless, if you encounter a problem with the CAPTCHA filling despite having a working internet, keep applying the remaining fixes.</p><h2 id="2-Switch-Your-Internet-Connection"><a href="#2-Switch-Your-Internet-Connection" class="headerlink" title="2. Switch Your Internet Connection"></a>2. Switch Your Internet Connection</h2><p> Is your internet connection stable? CAPTCHA verification can also be halted if your internet connection isn’t stable. Therefore, try changing your internet connection (if you have another one) and sign up again. If switching the internet connection doesn’t work, proceed to the next fix.</p><h2 id="3-Enable-or-Disable-a-VPN"><a href="#3-Enable-or-Disable-a-VPN" class="headerlink" title="3. Enable or Disable a VPN"></a>3. Enable or Disable a VPN</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/watch-us-tv-using-vpn.jpg"                      alt="Person using VPN on laptop"                ></p><p> The CAPTCHA might not be verified just because you are signing up from a location where Steam itself is banned. Thus, if you suspect that might be the case, enable your VPN. Doing so eliminates the possibility of IP issues resulting in the error under discussion. Similarly, if you are signing up with VPN enabled, you should disable it.</p><p> However, if enabling and disabling the VPN connection does not work, move on to the next fix.</p><h2 id="4-Rule-Out-Browser-Issues"><a href="#4-Rule-Out-Browser-Issues" class="headerlink" title="4. Rule Out Browser Issues"></a>4. Rule Out Browser Issues</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/desktop-screeshot-of-five-different-browsers.jpg"                      alt="edge firefox chrome opera and brave logos"                ></p><p> Steam CAPTCHA errors can also be caused by interference from your browser. If none of the above fixes work, you should rule out browser issues. You can do this by performing the following checks:</p><ul><li>Ensure a piled-up cache isn’t causing the issue by clearing your browser cache and cookies. If you’re unsure where to begin, you can read our guides describing the steps for <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-microsoft-edge-cache-browsing-data/" >clearing cookies and cache in Edge <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-clear-cookies-cache-in-chrome/" >Chrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/clear-cache-firefox/" >Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>To ensure that browser extensions aren’t causing the interference, temporarily disable them. An ad-blocking extension should be the first to disable, as it’s more likely to cause the problem.</li><li>Have you recently tweaked your browser security settings, which caused the issue we’re discussing? In this case, you may need to revert the changes. Resetting your browser will make reverting these changes much easier. See our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reset-chrome-firefox/" >how to reset Chrome and Firefox <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li></ul><h2 id="5-Flush-Your-DNS-Cache"><a href="#5-Flush-Your-DNS-Cache" class="headerlink" title="5. Flush Your DNS Cache"></a>5. Flush Your DNS Cache</h2><p> DNS cache flushing helps resolve major connectivity issues by removing outdated IP addresses and DNS records from the cache. You might have a DNS cache record that is preventing CAPTCHA verification. For this reason, flush it and rule out this possibility by following these steps:</p><ol><li>In the Windows Search box, type <strong>“Command Prompt,”</strong> right-click the app, and then select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> from the context menu.</li><li>Enter the following command:<br><code>ipconfig /flushdns   </code></li><li>Press the <strong>Enter</strong> key.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1-2.jpg"                      alt="Flushing DNS Cache by Running the Command in Command Prompt App on Windows"                ></li></ol><p> Apply the following fix if flushing the DNS cache doesn’t help.</p><h2 id="6-Reset-Winsock"><a href="#6-Reset-Winsock" class="headerlink" title="6. Reset Winsock"></a>6. Reset Winsock</h2><p> The <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-winsock/" >Winsock application programming interface <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, also known as Windows Socket API, acts as a translator between network services and Windows network software. As it handles all internet connections through TCP&#x2F;IP, you’re likely to encounter problems if it gets corrupt. Follow these steps to rule out this possibility:</p><ol><li>In the Windows Search box, type <strong>“Command Prompt,”</strong> right-click the app, and then select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> from the context menu.</li><li>Enter the following command:<br><code>netsh winsock reset</code></li><li>Press the <strong>Enter</strong> key.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/2-2.jpg"                      alt="Resetting Winsock by Running the Command in Command Prompt App on Windows"                ></li></ol><h2 id="7-Switch-Internet-Protocol-Version"><a href="#7-Switch-Internet-Protocol-Version" class="headerlink" title="7. Switch Internet Protocol Version"></a>7. Switch Internet Protocol Version</h2><p> Switching the IP version is just as crucial as resetting Winsock. IPv6 and IPv4 addresses are generally the two types of IP addresses used today. Even though we usually keep both versions enabled in network properties, IPv6 128-bit hexadecimal addresses are not supported by some internet connections.</p><p> Possibly, the CAPTCHA verification request generated might not be verified for the same reason. Due to this, you should temporarily switch to IPv4 and disable IPv6 (if it does not make things worse for you).</p><p> Follow these steps to make this change:</p><ol><li>In Windows Search, type <strong>“Network Connections”</strong> and click <strong>View network connections</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on your network connection and select <strong>Properties</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/3-2.jpg"                      alt="Opening Properties Option of the Network under Network Connections Option in Control Panel"                ></li><li>Uncheck the box for <strong>Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP&#x2F;IPv6)</strong>.<br><img src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/4-2.jpg" alt="Unchecking the Box for Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6) in the Properties Tab of the Network Connection"></li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol><h2 id="8-Use-a-Different-Device"><a href="#8-Use-a-Different-Device" class="headerlink" title="8. Use a Different Device"></a>8. Use a Different Device</h2><p> If the error persists after applying all the above fixes, you should create an account from another device. After signing up, you can go back to your primary device, log in to your Steam account, and start playing the game. If you still receive the same error, you can contact Steam support.</p><h2 id="Get-Rid-of-the-Steam-CAPTCHA-Error-for-Good"><a href="#Get-Rid-of-the-Steam-CAPTCHA-Error-for-Good" class="headerlink" title="Get Rid of the Steam CAPTCHA Error for Good"></a>Get Rid of the Steam CAPTCHA Error for Good</h2><p> After applying the fixes in the article, you should be able to fix the Steam CAPTCHA error quickly and verify the CAPTCHA. So, if a Steam CAPTCHA error has been preventing you from playing your favorite Steam game, hopefully, that will no longer be an issue.</p><p> Have you just joined Steam? If so, you should explore all the fantastic Steam features first. There are features that even pros may be unaware of, such as selling items for Steam wallet credits, using Steam overlays in-game, and using user-created mods.</p><p> When you fill in the CAPTCHA while creating an account on Steam, do you receive an error message saying, “Your response to the CAPTCHA appears to be invalid”? Most of the time, it happens when you fill in the CAPTCHA incorrectly, and it considers you a robot, so it throws an error telling you to fill it out again.</p><p> However, there are times when Steam throws this error even when the CAPTCHA is correctly filled out. Why does this happen? In this article, we’ll look at the reasons behind this error and what you can do to fix it.</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/caution-not-to-use-chatbots-for-windows-key-formation/"><u>Caution: Not to Use Chatbots For Windows Key Formation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/addressing-windows-steam-login-errors/"><u>Addressing Windows Steam Login Errors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/elevating-your-typing-speed-top-7-fixes-on-win-os/"><u>Elevating Your Typing Speed: Top 7 Fixes on WIN OS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/overcoming-package-discrepinas-in-windows-photos-with-step-by-step-tips/"><u>Overcoming Package Discrepinas in Windows Photos with Step-by-Step Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/windows-11-incorporating-a-god-mode-shortcut/"><u>Windows 11: Incorporating a God Mode Shortcut</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/microsoft-words-silent-mode-fix-for-pc-users/"><u>Microsoft Word's Silent Mode Fix for PC Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/steps-to-correct-steam-ui-dll-not-loaded-error/"><u>Steps to Correct Steam UI DLL Not Loaded Error</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-add-roles-in-discord/"><u>In 2024, How to Add Roles in Discord?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/weekends-boosted-by-facebooks-live-shopping-fridays/"><u>Weekends Boosted by Facebook’s Live Shopping Fridays</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-gifs-leading-platforms-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] Mastering GIFs  Leading Platforms Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-hidefake-snapchat-location-on-your-xiaomi-14-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Hide/Fake Snapchat Location on Your Xiaomi 14 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-20-essentials-every-new-creator-should-own-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] 20 Essentials Every New Creator Should Own for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-quick-fame-formula-amplify-your-insta-presence-with-content/"><u>[New] Quick Fame Formula  Amplify Your Insta Presence with Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastery-in-mac-screen-capture-format-conversion/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastery in Mac  Screen Capture Format Conversion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-lost-data-from-y36-by-fonelab-android-recover-data/"><u>How to recover lost data from Y36?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/harmonyhack-pro-v3-next-gen-audio-manipulation-for-singers-for-2024/"><u>HarmonyHack Pro V3 Next-Gen Audio Manipulation for Singers for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Driver updates are famous for fixing all sorts of problems; it’s therefore not a surprise when something goes awry with your audio driver, a quick audio driver update is the first thing that springs to mind.</p><p> In this article, we’ll look at the simplest ways to update your audio drivers on Windows. So let’s jump right in.</p><h2 id="Why-Update-Your-Audio-Driver"><a href="#Why-Update-Your-Audio-Driver" class="headerlink" title="Why Update Your Audio Driver?"></a>Why Update Your Audio Driver?</h2><p> To understand how a simple audio driver update can fix your sound issues, it’s essential to get a grip on what a driver is and why it matters.</p><p> A <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/computer-drivers-what-are-they-why-should-you-update/" >device driver <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a unique software that helps you work and manage your computer hardware connected to your PC. You can imagine them as an instruction manual for your computer, allowing it to understand what your devices are and how to manage them</p><p> An audio driver is a specific type of device driver, which, as its name suggests, plays a critical role in getting your audio drivers working. If something malfunctions with these audio drivers, it’s no surprise your computer starts giving you audio issues.</p><h2 id="1-How-to-Update-Your-Audio-Driver-via-Device-Manager"><a href="#1-How-to-Update-Your-Audio-Driver-via-Device-Manager" class="headerlink" title="1. How to Update Your Audio Driver via Device Manager"></a>1. How to Update Your Audio Driver via Device Manager</h2><p> The Device Manager is a built-in Windows applet that lets you manage all the hardware and its associated drivers of your PC, all from one place. You can even <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-device-manager-windows-10/" >use the Device Manager to diagnose issues on Windows 10 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> To access the Device Manager, head to the<strong>Start menu</strong> search bar, type in ‘device manager,’ and select the best match.</p><p> The Device Manager will be launched. From there, click on the dropdown menu of<strong>Sound, video, and game controllers</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/device-manager.jpg"                      alt="device manager"                ></p><p> Now, find the name of your audio device. Search online for the driver using the name of the audio device, and be sure to only download drivers from official sources.</p><p> Usually, you can double-click a downloaded driver and it will install itself. If this doesn’t work, right-click on the audio driver in Device Manager and select<strong>Update driver</strong> . Then, select<strong>Browse my computer for drivers</strong> , navigate to where you downloaded the new driver, and select it.</p><p>As soon as you do this, Windows will install the new audio drivers.</p><h2 id="2-How-to-Update-Your-Audio-Driver-Through-Windows-Update"><a href="#2-How-to-Update-Your-Audio-Driver-Through-Windows-Update" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Update Your Audio Driver Through Windows Update"></a>2. How to Update Your Audio Driver Through Windows Update</h2><p> If the Device Manager fails to work for you, then trying another method is in order. Windows Update, the free update and maintenance service by Microsoft, is your next best bet for this. Whenever you update your Windows, the Windows Update also looks up (and downloads) any driver updates that will be available to it.</p><p> To get started with Windows Update, head to the<strong>Start menu</strong> search bar, type in ‘settings,’ and select the best match. Alternatively, press<strong>Win + I</strong> . Then, from the left menu, click on the<strong>Windows Update</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/windows-update.jpg"                      alt="windows update"                ></p><p> On the Windows Update screen, click on<strong>Check for updates</strong> . Your Windows will start looking for updates released by Microsoft and update your audio drivers with new patches as soon as possible.</p><h2 id="Updating-the-Audio-Drivers-on-Windows"><a href="#Updating-the-Audio-Drivers-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Updating the Audio Drivers on Windows"></a>Updating the Audio Drivers on Windows</h2><p> Your PC’s audio drivers ensure your sound system keeps your sound on. Microsoft has made updates super easy over the years. Either of the above methods will get the job done for you. If they can’t, then it’s probably time to get to work on your update issues.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/avoiding-the-endless-void-fixing-xbox-app-errors-in-win11/"><u>Avoiding the Endless Void: Fixing Xbox App Errors in Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/windows-11-graphics-troubleshoot-and-restart-for-clear-images/"><u>Windows 11 Graphics: Troubleshoot & Restart for Clear Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/remedying-pc-performance-hurdles-with-intel-graphics-updates/"><u>Remedying PC Performance Hurdles with Intel Graphics Updates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/best-practices-choosing-the-right-win-video-codec/"><u>Best Practices: Choosing the Right Win Video Codec</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/bring-forth-dormant-windows-11-control-panel-options/"><u>Bring Forth Dormant Windows 11 Control Panel Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/resolve-poor-internet-access-in-windows-apps-now/"><u>Resolve Poor Internet Access in Windows Apps Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/bypassing-limitations-for-power-use-in-winos/"><u>Bypassing Limitations for Power Use in WinOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/add-life-to-your-footage-title-updating-techniques-in-photos-win-11-for-2024/"><u>Add Life to Your Footage  Title Updating Techniques in Photos Win 11 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/new-steps-to-create-gold-text-effects-after-effects/"><u>New Steps to Create Gold Text Effects After Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-mastering-fbs-video-ad-strategy-the-ultimate-blueprint-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering FB's Video Ad Strategy  The Ultimate Blueprint for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-updated-review-sonys-blu-ray-and-hd-masterpiece/"><u>In 2024, The Updated Review  Sony's Blu-Ray and HD Masterpiece</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-a-step-by-step-approach-to-implementing-audio-volume-diminuation/"><u>Updated In 2024, A Step-by-Step Approach to Implementing Audio Volume Diminuation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-top-10-free-video-editing-software-for-web-for-2024/"><u>Updated Top 10 Free Video Editing Software for Web for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/incorruptible-approach-to-disabling-youtubes-mini-videos/"><u>Incorruptible Approach to Disabling YouTube’s Mini Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/updated-gastronomy-galore-tiktoks-foreign-delicacies-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Gastronomy Galore  TikTok's Foreign Delicacies for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

If so, this can be a frustrating experience, especially when you need to type something urgently.</p><p> So, we’ll guide you through the solutions to help you fix the issue of your spacebar turning down the volume on Windows 11.</p><h2 id="1-Restart-Your-Computer"><a href="#1-Restart-Your-Computer" class="headerlink" title="1. Restart Your Computer"></a>1. Restart Your Computer</h2><p> If your spacebar has suddenly started to turn down the volume on your Windows 11, one of the first solutions you should try is restarting your computer.</p><p> It refreshes all programs and processes running in the background while clearing out any software conflicts that may be causing the issue. So, give it a try and check if that solves the problem.</p><h2 id="2-Tweak-the-Keyboard-Settings"><a href="#2-Tweak-the-Keyboard-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Tweak the Keyboard Settings"></a>2. Tweak the Keyboard Settings</h2><p> If your spacebar continues to turn down the volume even after restarting your computer, you should consider tweaking your keyboard settings. A few adjustments in the Control Panel may do the trick and restore the spacebar. Here is how you can do it:</p><ol><li>Open the Control Panel. If you need help, see our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-control-panel/" >how to open the Control Panel on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Then go to<strong>Ease of Access</strong> &gt;<strong>Make the Keyboard easier to use</strong> .</li><li>Uncheck the boxes next to<strong>Turn on Sticky Keys</strong> and<strong>Turn on Filter Keys</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/turn-off-sticky-keys-and-filter-keys.jpg"                      alt="Turn off Sticky keys and Filter keys"                ></li><li>Now click on<strong>Apply</strong> and<strong>OK</strong> .</li></ol><p> Once you’ve completed the above steps, close the window and try pressing the spacebar again to check if it is back to its normal functioning.</p><h2 id="3-Check-for-Third-Party-Software"><a href="#3-Check-for-Third-Party-Software" class="headerlink" title="3. Check for Third-Party Software"></a>3. Check for Third-Party Software</h2><p> If third-party software on your computer is interfering with the spacebar, then it needs to be identified and uninstalled. To do this, follow the below instructions:</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</strong> on your keyboard to open the Task Manager.</li><li>Go to the<strong>Processes</strong> tab and see if any suspicious apps are causing the issue.</li><li>Once you’ve identified the software, close the window and <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/" >open the System Settings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>In the Settings menu, go to<strong>Apps &gt; Installed apps</strong> .</li><li>Now scroll down to that faulty application, click on three dots, and select<strong>Uninstall</strong> from the option list.</li><li>Click<strong>Uninstall</strong> again if a pop-up menu appears and asks for confirmation.</li></ol><p> After uninstalling it, restart your computer and test the spacebar to see if it is fixed.</p><h2 id="4-Run-SFC-Scan-and-DISM-Tool"><a href="#4-Run-SFC-Scan-and-DISM-Tool" class="headerlink" title="4. Run SFC Scan and DISM Tool"></a>4. Run SFC Scan and DISM Tool</h2><p> Corrupted or missing system files can sometimes cause the spacebar to decrease the volume. If this is really what’s happening, running System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) scans should help solve it.</p><p> To learn more about these powerful tools, see our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/" >how to repair corrupt Windows files with Windows’ built-in tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="5-Update-the-Keyboard-Driver"><a href="#5-Update-the-Keyboard-Driver" class="headerlink" title="5. Update the Keyboard Driver"></a>5. Update the Keyboard Driver</h2><p> Sometimes an outdated or corrupted keyboard driver may also cause this issue. To be sure it’s not the case, you must check for any available updates to your keyboard drivers. Here’s how you can do it:</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + X</strong> on your keyboard and select<strong>Device Manager</strong> from the menu.</li><li>In the Device Manager window, locate the<strong>Keyboards</strong> section and then expand it.</li><li>Right-click the keyboard driver and choose<strong>Update driver</strong> from the context menu.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/update-the-keyboard-driver.jpg"                      alt="Update the Keyboard driver"                ></li><li>Next, select<strong>Search automatically for drivers</strong> and let Windows search for the latest version of the driver.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/search-automatically-for-drivers.jpg"                      alt="Search automatically for drivers"                ></li></ol><p> Once it’s done, restart your computer and check if the spacebar has stopped turning down the volume.</p><p> You could also try reinstalling the keyboard driver if the issue remains unresolved. To do this, right-click on the Keyboard driver and select<strong>Uninstall device</strong> from the menu that appears. After that, restart your computer, and Windows will automatically reinstall the updated driver.</p><h2 id="6-Run-the-Hardware-and-Devices-Troubleshooter"><a href="#6-Run-the-Hardware-and-Devices-Troubleshooter" class="headerlink" title="6.

Here’s how to use it:</p><ol><li>Right-click on Start and select<strong>Settings</strong> from the menu list.</li><li>In the Settings menu, choose<strong>System &gt; Troubleshoot</strong> .</li><li>Then click<strong>Other troubleshooters</strong> on the next page.</li><li>Scroll down to<strong>Keyboard</strong> , then click the<strong>Run</strong> option.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/run-the-keyboard-troubleshooter.jpg"                      alt="Run the Keyboard Troubleshooter"                ></li></ol><p> Wait for the troubleshooter to detect any issues with your keyboard. If it finds something wrong, follow the instructions on the screen to fix the problem.</p><h2 id="8-Check-for-Windows-Update"><a href="#8-Check-for-Windows-Update" class="headerlink" title="8. Check for Windows Update"></a>8. Check for Windows Update</h2><p> After you’ve gone through all the steps above and still experience the issue, chances are that your Windows version is outdated and needs updating. Installing the latest update can fix your spacebar not working properly.</p><p>To download and install the Windows Update, do the following:</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + I</strong> on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.</li><li>Select<strong>Windows Update</strong> from the left pane.</li><li>Now click the<strong>Check for updates</strong> button to let Windows search for available updates.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/check-for-updates.jpg"                      alt="Check for Updates"                ></li></ol><p> If you find any, download and install it. After that, restart your computer and check if it solves the issue.</p><h2 id="9-Perform-a-System-Restore"><a href="#9-Perform-a-System-Restore" class="headerlink" title="9. Perform a System Restore"></a>9. Perform a System Restore</h2><p> If nothing else works, then you can always perform a System Restore. This will roll back your system to when the spacebar is working properly.</p><p> To learn more about System Restore, see our detailed guide on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/" >how to use a restore point to restore your Windows 11 System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Stop-the-Keyboard-Spacebar-From-Interfering-With-Your-Computer’s-Volume"><a href="#Stop-the-Keyboard-Spacebar-From-Interfering-With-Your-Computer’s-Volume" class="headerlink" title="Stop the Keyboard Spacebar From Interfering With Your Computer’s Volume"></a>Stop the Keyboard Spacebar From Interfering With Your Computer’s Volume</h2><p> After you’ve gone through all these steps, your keyboard should already start working fine.

This OneDrive issue arises for some users when they try to open and copy files within their OneDrive storage folders.</p><p> Error 0x80070194 has a message that says, “The cloud file provider exited unexpectedly.” This means users can’t access their OneDrive files, and they can’t get anything done. So, this is how you can resolve error 0x80070194 in Windows 11 and Windows 10.</p><h2 id="1-Pause-and-Resume-Syncing"><a href="#1-Pause-and-Resume-Syncing" class="headerlink" title="1. Pause and Resume Syncing"></a>1. Pause and Resume Syncing</h2><p> First, try pausing and resuming OneDrive syncing, which has worked for some users. You can pause and resume OneDrive syncing like this:</p><ol><li>Right-click the<strong>OneDrive</strong> system tray icon and select the<strong>Help &amp; Settings</strong> button.</li><li>Click the<strong>Pause syncing</strong> option.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/pause-syncing-option.jpg"                      alt="The Pause syncing option"                ></li><li>Select<strong>2 hours</strong> on the menu.</li><li>Then wait for about five minutes.</li><li>Right-click OneDrive’s system tray icon again to select<strong>Help &amp; Settings</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/resume-syncing-option.jpg"                      alt="The Resume syncing option"                ></li><li>Click the<strong>Resume Syncing</strong> option.</li></ol><h2 id="2-Reset-OneDrive-with-Command-Prompt-Commands"><a href="#2-Reset-OneDrive-with-Command-Prompt-Commands" class="headerlink" title="2. Reset OneDrive with Command Prompt Commands"></a>2. Reset OneDrive with Command Prompt Commands</h2><p> Corrupted data in OneDrive’s cache is a common cause for error 0x80070194. Many OneDrive users have confirmed that clearing that cache by resetting OneDrive with the Command Prompt fixes error 0x80070194. This is how you can reset OneDrive:</p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/" >Run the Windows Command Prompt as an administrator <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Input this OneDrive reset command for resyncing and hit<strong>Enter</strong> :<br><code>%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset</code><br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/reset-onedrive-command.jpg"                      alt="The reset OneDrive command"                ></li><li>Next, execute the following command:<br><code>%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe</code><br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/onedrive-command.jpg"                      alt="Run OneDrive command"                ></li><li>Start OneDrive to see if the issue persists.</li></ol><h2 id="3-Disable-Files-On-Demand"><a href="#3-Disable-Files-On-Demand" class="headerlink" title="3. Disable Files On-Demand"></a>3. Disable Files On-Demand</h2><p> Files On-Demand is a feature that can sometimes cause OneDrive issues to arise. So, try disabling Files On-Demand in OneDrive to see if that makes any difference. You can turn off that feature as follows:</p><ol><li>Right-click OneDrive in the system tray to open the app’s window.</li><li>Press the<strong>Help &amp; Settings</strong> button.</li><li>Click<strong>Settings</strong> to view options.</li><li>Select<strong>Advanced Settings</strong> to expand the<strong>Sync and backup</strong> tab.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/files-on-demand-option.jpg"                      alt="The Files On-Demand option"                ></li><li>Turn off the<strong>File On-Demand</strong> option.</li></ol><h2 id="4-Unlink-and-Relink-Your-OneDrive-Account"><a href="#4-Unlink-and-Relink-Your-OneDrive-Account" class="headerlink" title="4. Unlink and Relink Your OneDrive Account"></a>4. Unlink and Relink Your OneDrive Account</h2><p> As error 0x80070194 is often a syncing issue, relinking your OneDrive account could be a potential solution. Doing so will restart the syncing when you re-establish an account link.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Calendar-Setup-Made-Simple-Windows-11-Edition"><a href="#Calendar-Setup-Made-Simple-Windows-11-Edition" class="headerlink" title="Calendar Setup Made Simple: Windows 11 Edition"></a>Calendar Setup Made Simple: Windows 11 Edition</h2><p> Windows 11 has a horde of underutilized tools that could improve people’s lives only if they started to use them yesterday. One of those tools is the Calendar app, an updated version of the Calendar app carried over from Windows 10 and its earlier versions.</p><p> With the Calendar app on Windows 11, you can do everything from creating an event reminder to a schedule setup—without the complexity that’s necessary for using third-party apps. So let’s look at all the ways you can make use of the Calendar app on Windows 11.</p><h2 id="1-Install-and-Set-Up-Your-Calendar-Account-on-Windows-11"><a href="#1-Install-and-Set-Up-Your-Calendar-Account-on-Windows-11" class="headerlink" title="1. Install and Set Up Your Calendar Account on Windows 11"></a>1. Install and Set Up Your Calendar Account on Windows 11</h2><p> If you are looking to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-local-user-account/" >set up your account on Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you first need to check if you have the Calendar app installed on your PC in the first place.</p><p> If you do not have the app, then follow the steps below to get the app right away:</p><ol><li>Launch the <strong>Microsoft Store</strong> app.</li><li>From the search bar on the top, type in ‘mail and calendar’, and select the <strong>Mail and Calendar</strong> app from Microsoft, as shown below.</li><li>Click on <strong>Install</strong> to get the app on your Windows 11.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/mail-and-calendar-app-on-microsoft-store-app.jpg"                      alt="mail and calendar app on microsoft store app"                ></p><p> As soon as you go through the above steps, installation of the Calendar app on your Windows 11 will begin in a few seconds. From there, sign in to the app with your Microsoft account, and you will be able to use the app from here on.</p><p> Once the app is installed, you find it from the Start menu search bar, from your taskbar, or you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-start-menu-add-remove-items/" >add the app to your Windows Start menu <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h2 id="2-Scheduler-Your-Events-in-Calendar"><a href="#2-Scheduler-Your-Events-in-Calendar" class="headerlink" title="2. Scheduler Your Events in Calendar"></a>2. Scheduler Your Events in Calendar</h2><p> Perhaps the most obvious—and also the most neglected—feature of a Calendar app on Windows is the event scheduler. Among a vast variety of schedule and reminder apps online today, it makes sense, too.</p><p> But if you’re a regular Windows user, you can skip the third-party apps without much to lose and instead use the free Calendar app from Microsoft. Here’s how:</p><ol><li>After you have downloaded the app, head to the <strong>Start menu</strong> search bar, type in ‘calendar’, and select the best match.</li><li>Put in your account credentials and login to get access to all features of the app.</li><li>Once you are in the Calendar, click on any date you’d like to set a reminder for, and you will see an instant window pop-up.</li><li>Now, you can put in the event name, time, and even the place of the event to fill in all the event details.</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to solidify the information, and you will be ready.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/event-on-the-calendar-app-1.jpg"                      alt="event on the calendar app"                ></p><p> After you have created the event as we laid down in the above steps, you will get the specified date marked with a notification, as you can see below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/event-on-the-calendar.jpg"                      alt="event on the calendar"                ></p><h2 id="3-Use-the-Calendar-Feature"><a href="#3-Use-the-Calendar-Feature" class="headerlink" title="3. Use the Calendar Feature"></a>3. Use the Calendar Feature</h2><p> When you first log in and start using the Calendar app, you will notice many default calendars on your app from before. You can add many more.</p><p> To add new calendars, click the <strong>Add calendars</strong> option from the bottom left corner.</p><p> From the newly launched <strong>Add calendars</strong> dialog box, you can select from a slew of calendar options: Holiday calendars, Sports, NBA, NHL, and so on. For example, click on <strong>Holiday calendars</strong>, and you will then get to select the country of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/calendars-menu-on-windows-11.jpg"                      alt="calendars menu on windows 11"                ></p><p> Now go back to your Calendar, and you will see all the essential festive dates marked as holidays in your famous festivals. In our case, we see the date for Labor Day, a prominent holiday celebrated in the USA, marked out differently from the rest.</p><p> You are, of course, free to add in multiple holiday calendars like this, whether of different countries or sports events.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/calendar-app-main-menu.jpg"                      alt="calendar app main menu"                ></p><p> Our only tip, though, will be to keep yourself from adding too many calendars right away; that will complicate your Calendar very quickly and will beat the very purpose of using Calendar.</p><h2 id="4-Syncing-Your-Calendar-With-Other-Devices"><a href="#4-Syncing-Your-Calendar-With-Other-Devices" class="headerlink" title="4. Syncing Your Calendar With Other Devices"></a>4. Syncing Your Calendar With Other Devices</h2><p> You can also use the Calendar with other apps on your PC, such as Outlook, iCloud, or Google. Click the <strong>Settings</strong> icon from the bottom left corner, and select <strong>Manage Accounts</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/calendar-app-accounts.jpg"                      alt="calendar app accounts"                ></p><p> Now click on <strong>Add account</strong>, and you can pick from Yahoo, Google, iCloud, or Office 365. Pick one, sign in with your account credentials, and that’s it—all your events and meetings from other accounts will be synced with your Calendar app.</p><h2 id="4-Tweak-Calendar-Settings-on-Windows"><a href="#4-Tweak-Calendar-Settings-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="4. Tweak Calendar Settings on Windows"></a>4. Tweak Calendar Settings on Windows</h2><p> The Calendar app also lets you control and manage its settings straight from the app menu on your Windows computer. Just click on the <strong>Settings</strong> from the bottom left corner and select <strong>Calendar Settings</strong>.</p><p> The Calendar Settings on your PC is the only place where you can tweak the first day of the week, your days in a week, and your working hours—it has a separate section for all the options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/calendar-app-accounts-1.jpg"                      alt="calendar app accounts settings"                ></p><p> Apart from this, the Calendar app offers a unique way to choose your language and a host of different calendars, such as Hijri, Saka Hera, and so on. So you should definitely play around with the settings and pick the ones that suit you best.</p><h2 id="5-Set-Reminders-Send-Invites"><a href="#5-Set-Reminders-Send-Invites" class="headerlink" title="5. Set Reminders &amp; Send Invites"></a>5. Set Reminders &amp; Send Invites</h2><p> After you have marked your event on the Calendar app, you can then also edit them to add reminders to stay on top of the event; the reminder can be set up to remind you before 1 week, 1 day, 5 minutes, 1 minute, and so on.</p><p> To invite someone to your meeting, just head to the <strong>People</strong> section and click on the <strong>Contacts</strong> icon. From there, start typing in your saved contacts and then select the best match to add and send an invitation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/calendar-menu.jpg"                      alt="calendar menu"                ></p><p> Another handy feature is <strong>Repeat</strong>, situated right above the <strong>People</strong> section. Just click on the <strong>Repeat</strong> icon, select how often you would like your event or reminder to repeat (weekly, monthly, or yearly), and put in the date and time. That’s it; your event will repeat from here on unless you cancel it manually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/repeat-feature-on-calendar.jpg"                      alt="repeat feature on calendar"                ></p><h2 id="Using-Your-Calendar-on-Windows-11-Computer"><a href="#Using-Your-Calendar-on-Windows-11-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Using Your Calendar on Windows 11 Computer"></a>Using Your Calendar on Windows 11 Computer</h2><p> And that, folks, is the Calendar app for you on Windows 11.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Blue-Screen-Decoded-Understanding-and-Fixing-0X0000003B-in-Win-OS"><a href="#Blue-Screen-Decoded-Understanding-and-Fixing-0X0000003B-in-Win-OS" class="headerlink" title="Blue Screen Decoded: Understanding and Fixing 0X0000003B in Win OS"></a>Blue Screen Decoded: Understanding and Fixing 0X0000003B in Win OS</h2><p> Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) errors can be frustrating and stressful. One such error that pops up when the system fails to execute an action is the 0x0000003B BSOD.</p><p> <strong>MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p> <strong>SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT</strong></p><p> It can be triggered by a corrupt system file, outdated drivers, an outdated operating system, and software conflicts. In short, both hardware and software-related issues can cause it. In the following sections, we will examine what the problem is and how you can fix it for good in no time.</p><h2 id="Understanding-the-Reasons-Behind-the-0x0000003B-Error-Code"><a href="#Understanding-the-Reasons-Behind-the-0x0000003B-Error-Code" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the Reasons Behind the 0x0000003B Error Code"></a>Understanding the Reasons Behind the 0x0000003B Error Code</h2><p> Before we jump into the troubleshooting methods, let’s understand the cause of the problem.</p><p> This issue occurs when a system service fails to execute properly. This can be caused due to both hardware and software-related issues. If the problem is related to hardware, then outdated drivers, faulty hardware, corrupt hard drive, malfunctioning graphics card, and some power supply issues can be leading to it.</p><p> If the problem is related to software, then conflicting programs that are running on your system can result in it. Your system might also be infected with a corruption error or malware that is preventing services from being executed properly. Lastly, your system might be outdated, which is causing compatibility issues, leading to the error.</p><p> Now that we know about the potential solutions, let’s take a look at the troubleshooting methods that can help you resolve the problem once and for all.</p><h2 id="1-Unplug-External-Peripherals"><a href="#1-Unplug-External-Peripherals" class="headerlink" title="1. Unplug External Peripherals"></a>1. Unplug External Peripherals</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/external-peripherals.jpg"                      alt="Wires connected to a computer"                ></p><p> Your external peripherals can be conflicting with system services or device drivers, leading to the error. This can include USB devices, printers, scanners, and other such components.</p><p> This is why the first thing that we recommend doing is removing any external devices that you have attached to the computer. Once this is done, try repeating the action that initially triggered the error and checking if the issue appears again. If it does not, then it implies that one of the external devices is the culprit.</p><p> If this scenario is applicable, plug in the devices one by one and check which triggers the error. Once you identify the faulty device, you can replace it.</p><h2 id="2-Run-a-System-Scan"><a href="#2-Run-a-System-Scan" class="headerlink" title="2. Run a System Scan"></a>2. Run a System Scan</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SFC-and-DISM-Scan.jpg"                      alt="SFC and DISM Scan"                ></p><p> The next thing we recommend doing is <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/" >running a system scan using the SFC and DISM tools <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> These two are built-in Windows tools that work by scanning the system for potential issues and then fixing them without requiring any user input. The SFC utility will scan the system for damaged files and replace the ones that are identified with their healthier cached counterparts.</p><p> DISM, on the other hand, is more powerful than SFC and is typically used to fix problems that SFC cannot resolve. It can also help repair a corrupt system image that might be leading to the problem. If the error under consideration is being caused due to a corruption error within the system, using the SFC and DISM tool together will help identify the problem and hopefully fix it for good.</p><h2 id="3-Run-Windows-Memory-Diagnostics"><a href="#3-Run-Windows-Memory-Diagnostics" class="headerlink" title="3. Run Windows Memory Diagnostics"></a>3. Run Windows Memory Diagnostics</h2><p> Another possible cause of this Blue Screen of Death issue is your system memory. You might have a faulty RAM that is resulting in data corruption or causing data to be written to the wrong location in memory, leading to the problem.</p><p> If this scenario is applicable, the best way to proceed is by <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-memory-diagnostic-tool-guide/" >using the Windows Memory Diagnostics tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . This tool will run a series of tests on your RAM to look for any issues. Once the tests are completed, it will restart your computer and the results will be displayed on your screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/windows-memory-diagnostic-tool-options.jpg"                      alt="windows memory diagnostic tool options"                ></p><p> In case a problem is identified by the tool, you can take appropriate steps such as switching RAM modules to fix it.</p><h2 id="4-Update-Network-and-Graphic-Drivers"><a href="#4-Update-Network-and-Graphic-Drivers" class="headerlink" title="4. Update Network and Graphic Drivers"></a>4. Update Network and Graphic Drivers</h2><p> In some cases, a problem with the network and graphics drivers can result in the 0x0000003B BSOD.</p><p> This typically happens when the drivers are either outdated or have become corrupt. Fortunately, the easiest way to fix this problem is by <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/" >updating your graphics drivers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to their latest versions. You can do that using the Device Manager utility in Windows.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/update-network-driver.jpg"                      alt="update network driver"                ></p><p> In case updating the drivers does not work, you can head over to your manufacturer’s official website and install the new and latest drivers from there directly. We do not recommend using random websites to install new drivers, since that is not safe. Using a third-party driver updating software is also not a good option, unless you are sure that the tool offers safe and legitimate drivers.</p><h2 id="5-Uninstall-Malwarebytes"><a href="#5-Uninstall-Malwarebytes" class="headerlink" title="5. Uninstall Malwarebytes"></a>5. Uninstall Malwarebytes</h2><p> If you are using Malwarebytes on your PC, then the security program is likely to cause the problem.</p><p> In most cases, Malwarebytes does not directly cause the error but indirectly contributes to it. This happens when the security program interferes with system processes while working in the background or is incompatible with other software on your system. These can lead to conflicts in the system, resulting in the error at hand.</p><p> The easiest way to identify if this is the case is by disabling or uninstalling Malwarebytes. For this, you can open the Control Panel and navigate to<strong>Programs</strong> &gt;<strong>Uninstall a program</strong> . Locate and right-click on Malwarebytes and choose<strong>Uninstall</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/uninstall-malwarebytes.jpg"                      alt="Uninstall Malwarebytes"                ></p><p> Once done, restart your computer and check if doing so fixed the problem.</p><h2 id="6-Perform-a-Clean-Boot"><a href="#6-Perform-a-Clean-Boot" class="headerlink" title="6. Perform a Clean Boot"></a>6. Perform a Clean Boot</h2><p> Like Malwarebytes, other third-party programs installed on your computer can also interfere with system processes in the background, causing issues like the one at hand.</p><p> A simple method to identify if a third-party program you recently installed is the culprit is by <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/" >performing a clean boot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . The clean boot is a diagnostic state which launches the system with a set of necessary drivers and programs only. If the issue does not occur in the clean boot state, it implies that the problem is being caused due to a background process you installed on the system.</p><p> In that case, you can try to uninstall the problematic software. If you are not sure which program might be causing the problem, it’s better to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/" >perform a system restore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> instead. Doing so will move your system back to a state where the BSOD was not present, fixing the issue.</p><h2 id="Your-Blue-Screen-of-Death-Issue-Now-Resolved"><a href="#Your-Blue-Screen-of-Death-Issue-Now-Resolved" class="headerlink" title="Your Blue Screen of Death Issue, Now Resolved"></a>Your Blue Screen of Death Issue, Now Resolved</h2><p> The methods listed above should help you fix the 0x0000003B BSOD successfully. If the error appears again, you can consider resetting Windows back to its default state. Doing so will revert Windows to the state it was when you first started using it. You can also report the issue to Microsoft using the Feedback hub. A specialist will help you identify the cause of the issue and then suggest a relevant fix.</p><p> To prevent the problem from occurring in the future, make sure you keep the operating system and its drivers up-to-date.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/autopilot-off-stopping-chromes-unwanted-tab-openings/"><u>Autopilot Off: Stopping Chrome's Unwanted Tab Openings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/decluttering-your-win11-desktop-wallpaper-symbol/"><u>Decluttering Your Win11 Desktop Wallpaper Symbol</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/leveraging-ai-to-enhance-shopping-on-the-ms-store/"><u>Leveraging AI to Enhance Shopping on the MS Store</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/breaking-down-the-barrier-of-windows-11-updates/"><u>Breaking Down the Barrier of Windows 11 Updates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/mastery-over-window-icon-positions/"><u>Mastery Over Window Icon Positions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/secure-and-streamline-with-win11s-hard-drive-defrag/"><u>Secure & Streamline with Win11's Hard Drive Defrag</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/quick-tips-for-syncing-two-windows-displays/"><u>Quick Tips for Syncing Two Windows Displays</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/keeping-your-win11-devices-running-smoothly-check-list-5/"><u>Keeping Your Win11 Devices Running Smoothly - Check List #5</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/resolving-black-screens-with-simple-win11-tweaks/"><u>Resolving Black Screens with Simple Win11 Tweaks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/swift-recovery-overcoming-black-screen-issues-in-wins/"><u>Swift Recovery: Overcoming Black-Screen Issues in Wins</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-10-audio-reversal-tools-latest-edition-for-pcs-and-mobile-devices/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Top 10 Audio Reversal Tools Latest Edition for PCs & Mobile Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-bypass-iphone-se-passcode-easily-video-inside-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Bypass iPhone SE Passcode Easily Video Inside</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-fueling-audience-interaction-crafting-intriguing-fb-giving-announcements/"><u>[New] Fueling Audience Interaction  Crafting Intriguing FB Giving Announcements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/new-crafting-seamless-sounds-for-your-podcasts-using-garageband/"><u>[New] Crafting Seamless Sounds for Your Podcasts Using GarageBand</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-on-honor-magic-6-lite-frp-bypass-by-drfone-android/"><u>Ultimate Guide on Honor Magic 6 Lite FRP Bypass</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/getting-the-pokemon-go-gps-signal-not-found-11-error-in-realme-note-50-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>Getting the Pokemon Go GPS Signal Not Found 11 Error in Realme Note 50 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-5-premium-audio-capture-apps-for-your-smartphone/"><u>New In 2024, Top 5 Premium Audio Capture Apps for Your Smartphone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-comprehensive-screen-recorder-guide-for-google-meet-users/"><u>2024 Approved  Comprehensive Screen Recorder Guide for Google Meet Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-embrace-creativity-how-to-attain-filmora-fcc-accreditation/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Embrace Creativity  How to Attain Filmora FCC Accreditation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-guide-to-choosing-top-subtitle-editors-online/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Guide to Choosing Top Subtitle Editors Online</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="7-Methods-for-Correcting-Unreachable-Display-Responses-in-Windows"><a href="#7-Methods-for-Correcting-Unreachable-Display-Responses-in-Windows" class="headerlink" title="7 Methods for Correcting Unreachable Display Responses in Windows"></a>7 Methods for Correcting Unreachable Display Responses in Windows</h2><p> To get the best picture and video performance on Windows, you need to often tweak your screen resolution settings. But things can be a bit complicated if your screen resolution settings are suddenly grayed out.</p><p> Don’t worry! We’ll show you the eight easy methods for fixing the grayed-out screen resolution settings.</p><p> Let’s get started.</p><h2 id="1-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Display-Drivers"><a href="#1-Update-or-Reinstall-the-Display-Drivers" class="headerlink" title="1. Update or Reinstall the Display Drivers"></a>1. Update or Reinstall the Display Drivers</h2><p> Display drivers (also known as Graphical drivers) are responsible for enabling your computer to accurately display images, videos, and other visual content. However, o​​​​​​utdated or incompatible display drivers can result in poor performance and visual glitches.</p><p> So, it’s possible that you can’t access the screen resolution settings due to corrupted display drivers.

And in such an instance, here are the solutions that could help:</p><ul><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-boot-safe-mode/" >Boot into Safe Mode <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>: When the system is in Safe Mode, your device starts with a basic set of drivers and files essential to run the system. This can help you determine if a third-party program (or an external hardware driver) is the one causing the “grayed-out screen resolution settings” issue.</li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/" >Perform a Clean Boot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>: When you perform a clean boot, the system starts with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. Just like Safe Mode, this can also help you determine if a third-party program or hardware driver is the one causing issues.</li><li><strong>Update or Remove Faulty Apps</strong>: If you find that a third-party app is the one behind the issue at hand, then update it and see if that helps. Otherwise, remove the app and reinstall it from a reputed site. When deleting a suspicious program, it’s best to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-iobit-uninstaller-batch-uninstall/" >use a reliable third-party uninstaller <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This will remove all the residual files that might remain and cause more issues.</li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/use-system-restore-windows/" >Perform a System Restore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>: When you use a restore point, the system will undo recent changes to your system without deleting your files.

However, some users can’t record anything with the Game Bar because of an error that says, “sorry, your PC doesn’t meet the hardware requirements for captures.” That error message can appear within Settings or when users select to record.</p><p> The error message highlights a PC doesn’t meet system requirements for Game Bar recording. Yet, this error often arises for users who’ve utilized Game Bar’s recording on their PCs before. This is how you can fix the “PC doesn’t meet the hardware requirements for captures” error in Windows 10 and 11.</p><h2 id="Enable-Game-DVR-With-Game-DVR-Config"><a href="#Enable-Game-DVR-With-Game-DVR-Config" class="headerlink" title="Enable Game DVR With Game DVR Config"></a>Enable Game DVR With Game DVR Config</h2><p> Game DVR Config is third-party software with which some users have resolved the “PC doesn’t meet the hardware requirements for captures” error.

So, Windows Pro and Enterprise users must make sure that the Game Recording and Broadcasting policy is set to enabled. Do note that Windows Home doesn’t include the Group Policy Editor.</p><p> Here is how you can enable that policy:</p><ol><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/open-local-group-policy-editor-windows/" >Open Local Group Policy Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and double-click <strong>Computer Configuration</strong> when it appears.</li><li>Double-click <strong>Administrative Templates</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Components</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Windows Game Recording and Broadcasting</strong> in Group Policy’s sidebar.</li><li>Then double-click on the <strong>Enables or disables Windows Game Recording and Broadcasting</strong> policy.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/group-policy-editor.jpg"                      alt="The Group Policy Editor window"                ></li><li>Click <strong>Enabled</strong> if that policy is disabled.</li><li>Select <strong>Apply</strong> to enable the recording policy and <strong>OK</strong> to close the window.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/windows-game-and-recording-policy-window.jpg"                      alt="The Enables or disables Windows Game Recording and Broadcasting policy window"                ></li><li>Close Group Policy Editor, bring up your Start menu and select <strong>Power</strong> &gt; <strong>Restart</strong>.</li></ol><h2 id="Erase-Data-in-the-GameDVR-Registry-Key"><a href="#Erase-Data-in-the-GameDVR-Registry-Key" class="headerlink" title="Erase Data in the GameDVR Registry Key"></a>Erase Data in the GameDVR Registry Key</h2><p> Corrupted GameDVR entries within the registry can cause the “PC doesn’t meet the hardware requirements for captures” error. You can fix that by deleting DWORDs and strings in the GameDVR registry key, which will automatically regenerate. However, we still recommend users back up the registry before applying this potential solution.</p><p> You can erase data from the GameDVR registry key as follows:</p><ol><li>Open Registry Editor with Run, as covered in the first couple of steps of resolution two.</li><li>Go to this GameDVR registry key location:<br><code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\GameDVR</code></li><li>Select all DWORDs and strings within the GameDVR key by holding the <strong>Ctrl</strong> key and clicking on them.</li><li>Then right-click and select <strong>Delete</strong> &gt; <strong>Yes</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/the-delete-option.jpg"                      alt="the-delete-option"                ></li><li>Click the Start menu’s Power button and select <strong>Restart</strong>.</li></ol><h2 id="Get-Recording-Again-With-the-Xbox-Game-Bar"><a href="#Get-Recording-Again-With-the-Xbox-Game-Bar" class="headerlink" title="Get Recording Again With the Xbox Game Bar"></a>Get Recording Again With the Xbox Game Bar</h2><p> The potential solutions covered here are widely confirmed to resolve the “PC doesn’t meet the hardware requirements for captures” by users who’ve needed to fix that issue.

It’s a genuine Windows process responsible for providing a stable audio experience. This guide explains what this process does, why you shouldn’t turn it off, and how you can reduce its resource consumption.</p><h2 id="What-Is-the-“Windows-Audio-Device-Graph-Isolation”-Process"><a href="#What-Is-the-“Windows-Audio-Device-Graph-Isolation”-Process" class="headerlink" title="What Is the “Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation” Process?"></a>What Is the “Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation” Process?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/windows-audio-device-graph-isolation-service-consuming-high-memory-in-windows-task-manager.jpg"                      alt="Windows audio device graph isolation process consuming high memory in Windows Task Manager"                ></p><p> The “Windows Audio Device Graph Isolation” process, referred to as audiodg.exe, is at the core of Windows 11’s audio system.</p><p> The process manages audio enhancements and effects applied to the audio output, including equalization, spatial sound, and other audio modifications. Under the hood, it processes sound data and manages the network of connected audio components, like your sound card, drivers, and playback device.</p><p> The service is kept isolated from the standard Windows audio service. This “sandboxing” allows third-party audio manufacturers to include their sound enhancement settings (for instance, equalizer effects) without affecting the Windows audio service. Any error doesn’t crash Windows if a particular audio application, driver, or process malfunctions.</p><p> Thus, the intentional “sandboxing” provides a more responsive and reliable audio experience. But why does audiodg.exe sometimes consume extensive system resources?</p><h2 id="Why-Does-Audiodg-exe-Show-a-High-CPU-Usage-and-Can-You-Disable-It"><a href="#Why-Does-Audiodg-exe-Show-a-High-CPU-Usage-and-Can-You-Disable-It" class="headerlink" title="Why Does Audiodg.exe Show a High CPU Usage, and Can You Disable It?"></a>Why Does Audiodg.exe Show a High CPU Usage, and Can You Disable It?</h2><p> The process typically uses a minimal percentage of the CPU and operates efficiently. Its resource usage can increase if you apply too many sound effects, a third-party audio software consumes resources to deliver high-quality sound, or the audio drivers get corrupted.</p><p> This leads to the question: can you turn off this process if the resource usage gets too high? No, this process is an integral part of Windows’ audio system. Disabling it causes audio problems and errors. We turned off this process, played a YouTube video afterward, and encountered the <strong>“Audio renderer error. Please restart your computer”</strong> error.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/audio-renderer-failed-error.jpg"                      alt="Encountering an audio renderer error when playing a youtube video"                ></p><p> So, if you don’t want to run into audio problems, don’t turn off this process—you won’t hear any sound. Instead, adjust the audio settings to make it use fewer resources. As a core service, you should never terminate it like other vital Task Manager processes.</p><h2 id="How-to-Reduce-the-Resource-Consumption-of-Audiodg-exe"><a href="#How-to-Reduce-the-Resource-Consumption-of-Audiodg-exe" class="headerlink" title="How to Reduce the Resource Consumption of Audiodg.exe"></a>How to Reduce the Resource Consumption of Audiodg.exe</h2><p> As this process is notorious for its high resource consumption, malicious programs can disguise themselves as audiodg.exe and exploit your system resources. So, you should first <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-tell-if-exe-file-is-safe/" >verify that the resource-consuming process in the Task Manager isn’t any malware <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. If the process turns out to be malicious, you should <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-remove-malware-using-microsoft-defenders-offline-scan/" >run a Windows Defender scan <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to remove it.</p><p> If it’s a genuine Windows process, here are some ways to reduce its resource usage:</p><ul><li>Ensure you have the latest audio drivers installed. Download the latest audio driver from the manufacturer’s website. If it comes in an executable format, click on the file to install it automatically. If a manual installation is required, right-click the <strong>Start</strong> button and open <strong>Device Manager</strong>. Then, expand the <strong>Sound, video, and game controllers</strong> tab, right-click on the relevant driver, and select <strong>Update driver</strong>.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/updating-audio-drivers-in-device-manager-on-windows.jpg"                      alt="Updating audio drivers in Device Manager on Windows"                ><br> Then, click <strong>Browse my computer for drivers</strong>, locate and select the downloaded driver, and Windows will install it.</li><li>Adjust the default audio format in the sound settings. Press <strong>Win+R</strong>, type <strong>“ms-settings:sound</strong>,<strong>“</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.

You can use it to view, create, and edit text files whenever needed. But what if Windows fails to open Notepad and you can’t use it?</p><p> Several factors, ranging from a temporary app glitch to corrupt user account files, can prevent Notepad from opening on Windows. Fortunately, there are some quick fixes you can use to regain access to the Notepad app on Windows.</p><h2 id="1-Use-Alternative-Methods-to-Open-Notepad"><a href="#1-Use-Alternative-Methods-to-Open-Notepad" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Alternative Methods to Open Notepad"></a>1. Use Alternative Methods to Open Notepad</h2><p> Before you try any advanced solutions, see if you can open Notepad using the Run tool. Press<strong>Win + R</strong> to open the Run dialog box. Type<strong>notepad</strong> in the Open field and press<strong>Enter</strong> .</p><p> If that doesn’t work, try opening Notepad through a command-line tool. Open the search menu to launch<strong>Command Prompt</strong> or<strong>PowerShell</strong> . In the console, type<strong>notepad</strong> and then press<strong>Enter</strong> .</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/open-notepad-via-command-line-tool.jpg"                      alt="Open Notepad via Command-Line Tool"                ></p><p> You could also ask Cortana to open Notepad. However, if none of these methods work, proceed to the next solution.</p><h2 id="2-Set-Notepad-as-the-Default-Text-Editor"><a href="#2-Set-Notepad-as-the-Default-Text-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2. Set Notepad as the Default Text Editor"></a>2. Set Notepad as the Default Text Editor</h2><p> If Notepad is not set as the default text editor app on Windows, your text files may open in a different app. If you don’t want that, use these steps to set Notepad as the default text editor app.</p><ol><li>Open the<strong>Start menu</strong> and click the<strong>gear icon</strong> to launch the Settings app.</li><li>Navigate to the<strong>Apps</strong> tab.</li><li>Select<strong>Default apps</strong> from the right pane.</li><li>Scroll all the way down to the<strong>Related settings</strong> section.</li><li>Click<strong>Choose defaults by file type</strong> .</li><li>Type**.txt** in the search box and click the current default app.</li><li>Select<strong>Notepad</strong> and click the<strong>Set default</strong> button.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/set-notepad-as-default-text-editor-app-on-windows.jpg"                      alt="Set Notepad as Default Text Editor App on Windows"                ></li></ol><p>Try opening a few text files and see if they open in Notepad.</p><h2 id="3-Repair-or-Reset-the-Notepad-App"><a href="#3-Repair-or-Reset-the-Notepad-App" class="headerlink" title="3. Repair or Reset the Notepad App"></a>3. Repair or Reset the Notepad App</h2><p> The built-in repair tool on Windows is quite efficient when it comes to fixing minor app-related issues. Microsoft recommends using this tool when an app fails to open or does not work as expected on your Windows computer.</p><p>To repair the Notepad app on Windows:</p><ol><li>Right-click the Start icon or press<strong>Win + X</strong> to open the Power User menu.</li><li>Select<strong>Installed apps</strong> from the list.</li><li>Scroll down or use the search tool to locate<strong>Notepad</strong> on the app list.</li><li>Click the<strong>three-dot menu icon</strong> next to Notepad and select<strong>Advanced options</strong> .</li><li>Scroll down to the Reset section and click the<strong>Repair</strong> button.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/repair-or-reset-the-notepad-app.jpg"                      alt="Repair or Reset the Notepad App"                ></li></ol><p> You should see a checkmark next to the Repair button once the process is complete. Then, try to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-notepad/" >open the Notepad app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> again.</p><p> If repairing the Notepad app does not make any difference, you can try resetting it. Here are the steps for the same.</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + S</strong> to open the search menu.</li><li>Type<strong>Notepad</strong> in the search box and select<strong>App settings</strong> .</li><li>Under the Reset section, click the<strong>Reset</strong> button.</li></ol><p> Windows will reset the Notepad app to its default version, which should resolve any issues with it.</p><h2 id="4-Reinstall-the-Notepad-App"><a href="#4-Reinstall-the-Notepad-App" class="headerlink" title="4. Reinstall the Notepad App"></a>4. Reinstall the Notepad App</h2><p> You can also try uninstalling and reinstalling the Notepad app on your computer. To do so, you’ll need to access the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-optional-features-guide/" >optional features on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Here’s how you can go about it.</p><ol><li>Press<strong>Win + I</strong> to launch the Settings app.</li><li>Navigate to<strong>Apps &gt; Optional features</strong> .</li><li>Click on<strong>Notepad</strong> to expand it.</li><li>Click the<strong>Uninstall</strong> button.<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/uninstall-notepad-app-on-windows.jpg"                      alt="Uninstall Notepad App on Windows"                ></li><li>Wait for Windows to uninstall Notepad from your computer.</li><li>Next, click the<strong>View features</strong> button at the top.</li><li>Type<strong>Notepad</strong> in the search box.</li><li>Tick the<strong>Notepad (system)</strong> checkbox and click<strong>Next</strong> .</li><li>Click<strong>Install</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/install-notepad-app-on-windows.jpg"                      alt="Install Notepad App on Windows"                ></li></ol><p> Wait for Windows to install Notepad on your computer and then try to open it using the search menu.</p><h2 id="5-Run-the-SFC-and-DISM-Scans"><a href="#5-Run-the-SFC-and-DISM-Scans" class="headerlink" title="5. Run the SFC and DISM Scans"></a>5. Run the SFC and DISM Scans</h2><p> Corrupted system files could also interfere with system processes and prevent Notepad from opening. The System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in utility that can help you repair system files on Windows. It basically scans your system for damaged system files and replaces them with their cached versions.</p><p>To run the SFC scan on Windows:</p><ol><li>Click the magnifying icon on the taskbar to open the search menu.</li><li>Type<strong>command prompt</strong> in the box and select<strong>Run as administrator</strong> .</li><li>When the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears, select<strong>Yes</strong> to continue.</li><li>In the console, input the following command and press<strong>Enter</strong> :<br><code>sfc /scannow</code></li></ol><p> Wait for the scan to complete and then enter the following command to run the DISM (or Deployment Image Servicing and Management) scan. It will try to detect and repair any issues with the system image.</p><p><code>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</code></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dism-scan-in-windows-terminal.jpg"                      alt="DISM Scan in Windows Terminal"                ></p><p> After the scan is complete, restart your PC and see if you can access Notepad.</p><h2 id="6-Perform-a-Clean-Boot"><a href="#6-Perform-a-Clean-Boot" class="headerlink" title="6. Perform a Clean Boot"></a>6. Perform a Clean Boot</h2><p> At times, third-party apps and background services can conflict with Windows processes and cause problems like the one discussed here. One way to verify this possibility is to boot your computer in a clean boot state, where it only runs with essential apps and services.</p><p> If you perform a clean boot and Notepad opens normally, it means that the culprit causing the issue got disabled. If you’d like to learn more about the topic, check out our guide on <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-perform-clean-boot-windows-10/" >how to perform a clean boot on Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and follow the steps listed there.</p><h2 id="7-Create-Another-User-Account"><a href="#7-Create-Another-User-Account" class="headerlink" title="7. Create Another User Account"></a>7. Create Another User Account</h2><p> If some of the files in your user account have become corrupt, you may have difficulty performing simple tasks like opening an app. If that seems to be the case, your best option is to create and switch to a new user account.</p><p>To create a new user account on Windows:</p><ol><li>Use one of the <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/" >many ways to open the Settings app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</li><li>Navigate to<strong>Accounts &gt; Other users</strong> .</li><li>Click the<strong>Add account</strong> button.</li><li>In the Microsoft account window, click <strong>I don’t have this person’s sign-in information</strong> .<br><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/microsoft-account-sign-in-window.jpg"                      alt="Microsoft Account Sign-In Window"                ></li></ol><p> Follow the on-screen prompts to create a new user account. Make sure you give the new account administrative privileges so that you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-copy-files-between-user-accounts/" >move your personal files and data to the new account <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with ease.</p><p> Once you sign in with your newly created account, Notepad should open without problems.</p><h2 id="Start-Using-Notepad-Again"><a href="#Start-Using-Notepad-Again" class="headerlink" title="Start Using Notepad Again"></a>Start Using Notepad Again</h2><p> Hopefully, the solutions provided above have helped, and you’re able to use Notepad again. However, if none of the above solutions work, you can perform a system restore to undo any recent changes that may have caused the problem.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/activating-storage-efficiency-tools-for-pcs/"><u>Activating Storage Efficiency Tools for PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/how-to-stabilize-an-unstable-printer-on-windows/"><u>How to Stabilize an Unstable Printer on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/restoring-access-to-disabled-windows-apps/"><u>Restoring Access to Disabled Windows Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/strategies-for-winmedia-error-resolution/"><u>Strategies for WinMedia Error Resolution</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/unveiling-windows-11-entry-into-the-insider-trials/"><u>Unveiling Windows 11: Entry Into the Insider Trials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/boost-productivity-with-these-5-essential-windows-folder-practices/"><u>Boost Productivity with These 5 Essential Windows Folder Practices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://windows11.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-dropboxs-high-cpu-usage-on-windows/"><u>How to Fix Dropbox's High CPU Usage on Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/approved-how-to-achieve-professional-level-audio-quality-on-youtube/"><u>2024 Approved  How to Achieve Professional-Level Audio Quality on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-sign-excel-2021-document-online-by-ldigisigner-sign-a-excel-sign-a-excel/"><u>How to sign Excel 2021 document online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/top-5-infinix-bypass-frp-tools-for-pc-that-actually-work-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 5 Infinix Bypass FRP Tools for PC That Actually Work</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-a-step-by-step-guide-to-crafting-captivating-podcast-scripts-plus-free-examples/"><u>[New] A Step-By Step Guide to Crafting Captivating Podcast Scripts (Plus Free Examples)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-infinix-smart-8-pro-phone-pattern-lock-without-factory-reset-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Unlock Infinix Smart 8 Pro Phone Pattern Lock without Factory Reset</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/the-zoomers-guide-to-instagram-story-clarity-for-2024/"><u>The Zoomer’s Guide to Instagram Story Clarity for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-connoisseur-of-cinematic-composition/"><u>2024 Approved  Connoisseur of Cinematic Composition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-editors-handbook-to-dynamic-ducking-implementing-complex-auditory-effects-with-windows-adobe-premiere-pro/"><u>Updated In 2024, The Editors Handbook to Dynamic Ducking Implementing Complex Auditory Effects with Windows Adobe Premiere Pro</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

If it stops working for any reason, it can disrupt your ability to use the internet or connect to other devices on your network.</p><p> If you are experiencing the same issue, don’t worry. This guide contains some useful troubleshooting tips that should get the network adapter working on your Windows 10 or 11 PC.</p><h2 id="1-Check-the-Network-Adapter-Status"><a href="#1-Check-the-Network-Adapter-Status" class="headerlink" title="1.

We’ll take you through the easy methods that can help you tackle this issue once and for all.</p><p> Let’s dive in!</p><h2 id="1-Run-PowerShell-in-Administrator-Mode"><a href="#1-Run-PowerShell-in-Administrator-Mode" class="headerlink" title="1. Run PowerShell in Administrator Mode"></a>1. Run PowerShell in Administrator Mode</h2><p> Are you currently running PowerShell without proper administrative rights? If so, then perhaps that’s where the issue lies.</p><p> So, let’s explore the steps you should apply to run the tool in administrator mode:</p><ol><li>Press <strong>Win + X</strong> to open the Quick Access menu.</li><li>Select the <strong>Windows PowerShell (Admin)</strong> option.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/selecting-the-windows-powershell-admin-option-on-the-quick-access-menu.jpg"                      alt="Selecting the Windows PowerShell (Admin) option on the Quick Access Menu"                ></p><p> And if that doesn’t help, check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-command-prompt-powershell/" >the various ways to open Windows PowerShell <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. But you should only focus on the methods that show you how to run the tool with administrative privileges.</p><h2 id="2-Change-the-Execution-Policy-in-PowerShell"><a href="#2-Change-the-Execution-Policy-in-PowerShell" class="headerlink" title="2. Change the Execution Policy in PowerShell"></a>2. Change the Execution Policy in PowerShell</h2><p> In some instances, changing the execution policy could help. But before we explore the solutions, let’s first take you through what the execution policy is and how it works.</p><h3 id="What-Is-the-Execution-Policy-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#What-Is-the-Execution-Policy-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Execution Policy, and How Does It Work?"></a>What Is the Execution Policy, and How Does It Work?</h3><p> The execution policy is a security feature that controls the way you run PowerShell scripts on your device. It simply determines which types of scripts can be run and which ones should be avoided. The best part is that you can configure this policy to your liking.</p><p> Here are the options you can pick from when configuring the execution policy:</p><ul><li><strong>Restricted</strong>: This policy prohibits you from running any PowerShell script.</li><li><strong>Unrestricted</strong>: Allows you to run any script but shows you a warning message when you run suspicious scripts.</li><li><strong>RemoteSigned</strong>: This policy requires a digital signature when you run the scripts that you downloaded online. However, it doesn’t require a signature for local scripts.</li><li><strong>ByPass</strong>: This allows you to run any script without any restrictions. Unlike the “Unrestricted” policy, the “ByPass” policy won’t show you any warning messages when you run suspicious scripts. So, always apply this policy only when running legit scripts.</li><li><strong>AllSigned</strong>: This policy only runs scripts that are signed by a trusted publisher.</li></ul><p> Now, if you use PowerShell regularly, then you might want to change the execution policy from time to time. However, some execution policies might display error messages when you run your PowerShell scripts.</p><p> For example, enabling the “Restricted,” “AllSigned,” or “RemoteSigned” policies might lead to error messages like the “running scripts is disabled” error.</p><p> To resolve the problem, you’d simply have to change the execution policy to “Unrestricted” or “ByPass.” But that’s not all; you’d also need to decide how the policy should be implemented. For example, do you want to apply the policy for all users or just for your current PowerShell session?</p><p> Let’s explore all the additional <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-powershell-commands-cmdlets/" >PowerShell commands <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you’ll have to add when changing the execution policy:</p><ul><li><strong>CurrentUser</strong>: This policy will only be applied to all the PowerShell sessions of the person who has currently logged in on the device.</li><li><strong>LocalMachine</strong>: Applies to all the users that have an account on the device. This policy can only be configured by local users that have administrative privileges.</li><li><strong>Process</strong>: Only applies on the current PowerShell session. This means you’ll have to execute the policy again if you start a new session.</li><li><strong>MachinePolicy</strong>: This policy applies to all the users who have an account on your device. However, it can only be configured by network administrators who have appropriate permissions. But it’s often possible for local administrators to configure this execution policy using the Local Group Policy Editor.</li><li><strong>UserPolicy</strong>: Applies to all PowerShell sessions and the scripts executed by a particular user.</li></ul><p> Now that everything is clear, let’s explore how you can execute the relevant policies to tackle the “PowerShell cannot load” issue.</p><h3 id="How-to-Change-the-Execution-Policy-to-“Unrestricted”"><a href="#How-to-Change-the-Execution-Policy-to-“Unrestricted”" class="headerlink" title="How to Change the Execution Policy to “Unrestricted”"></a>How to Change the Execution Policy to “Unrestricted”</h3><p> The best way to tackle the issue at hand is to change the execution policy to “unrestricted.” But before that, you need to check how each execution policy is configured.</p><p> Here are the steps for checking how the execution policies are configured:</p><ol><li>Press <strong>Win + X</strong> to open the Quick Access Menu.</li><li>Select <strong>Windows PowerShell (Admin)</strong> from the options.</li><li>Type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong>:</li></ol><p><code>Get-ExecutionPolicy -List</code></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/displaying-the-list-of-execution-policies.jpg"                      alt="Displaying the list of execution policies"                ></p><p> This should show you how the execution policies are configured for different users and systems.</p><p> To can change the execution policy to “Unrestricted” for the current active user, type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong>:</p><p><code>Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser</code></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/setting-the-execution-policy-on-powershell.jpg"                      alt="Setting the execution policy on PowerShell"                ></p><p> To change the execution policy to “Unrestricted” for all users, type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong>:</p><p><code>Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope LocalMachine</code></p><p> When you finish running the command, close PowerShell and restart your PC to save these changes.</p><h3 id="How-to-Change-the-Execution-Policy-to-“ByPass”"><a href="#How-to-Change-the-Execution-Policy-to-“ByPass”" class="headerlink" title="How to Change the Execution Policy to “ByPass”"></a>How to Change the Execution Policy to “ByPass”</h3><p> The “ByPass” execution policy will allow you to run any PowerShell script without a hassle. But remember that it might also allow you to run buggy files. So, always configure this execution policy only when running trustworthy PowerShell files.</p><p> To change the execution policy to “ByPass” for the current active user, type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong>:</p><p><code>Set-ExecutionPolicy ByPass -Scope CurrentUser</code></p><p> And to change the execution policy to “ByPass” for all users, type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong>:</p><p><code>Set-ExecutionPolicy ByPass -Scope LocalMachine</code></p><p> When you finish, close PowerShell and then restart your device.</p><h2 id="3-Change-the-Execution-Policy-Via-the-Local-Group-Policy-Editor"><a href="#3-Change-the-Execution-Policy-Via-the-Local-Group-Policy-Editor" class="headerlink" title="3.

In fact, this tool can also help you configure various system settings or troubleshoot tons of PC issues.</p><p> Remember, the main aim is to change the execution policy such that you’ll be able to run your PowerShell scrips without a hassle. And by so doing, you’ll get rid of the “running scripts is disabled” error on PowerShell.</p><p> Here’s how to change the execution policy in the LGPE:</p><ol><li>Type <strong>Edit group policy</strong> in the Start menu search bar and select the <strong>Best match</strong>. Alternatively, check out <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-local-group-policy-editor/" >the various ways to open the LGPE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li>Navigate to <strong>Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows PowerShell</strong>.</li><li>Double-click on the <strong>Turn on Script Execution</strong> option.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/clicking-the-turn-on-script-execution-option.jpg"                      alt="Clicking the Turn on Script Execution option"                ></p><p> Check the <strong>Enabled</strong> box. From there, click the <strong>Execution Policy</strong> drop-down menu and select <strong>Allow local scripts and remote signed scripts</strong>. This option is similar to the “RemoteSigned” option that we discovered earlier.</p><p> If you want to run all scripts without restrictions, pick the <strong>Allow all scripts</strong> option from the “Execution Policy” drop-down menu.</p><p> From there, click <strong>Apply</strong> and then click <strong>OK</strong> to save these changes.</p><h2 id="4-Change-the-Execution-Policy-Using-the-Registry-Editor"><a href="#4-Change-the-Execution-Policy-Using-the-Registry-Editor" class="headerlink" title="4.
