## Why Does the “Your Windows License Will Expire Soon” Error Appear?

 The "Your Windows license will expire soon" error message can occur due to several factors, and here are the most prevalent ones:

* **Windows license is invalid:** Using an unauthorized or pirated version of Windows is one of the most common reasons why you might encounter this error message.
* **Hardware changes:** Performing hardware changes, such as replacing the motherboard in your system, can also lead to activation errors on Windows.
* **Connectivity issues:** Your computer might fail to connect to the Key Management Service (KMS) server due to network-related issues, resulting in activation errors.
* **Corrupt Activation Token files:** The **Tokens.dat** file contains the activation information for your Windows installation. If this file becomes inaccessible for some reason, you may encounter the “Your Windows license will expire soon” error on Windows.

 Wait for Command Prompt to validate your product key. You will see a message confirming the outcome of the activation process, whether it was successful or not. If the activation is successful, you should not see the “Your Windows license will expire soon” error after this.

## 5\. Rebuild the Tokens.dat File

 Tokens.dat is a system file related to Windows activation and licensing. If this file somehow gets corrupted, Windows may have trouble verifying the authenticity of your license and trouble you with the “Your Windows license will expire soon” error.

1. Right-click on the **Start icon** or use the **Win + X** keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu.

cd %windir%\system32\spp\store\2.0  
ren tokens.dat tokens.bar  
net start sppsvc  
cscript.exe %windir%\system32\slmgr.vbs /rilc`

 Restart your computer after running the above commands and then check if you still get the “Your Windows license will expire soon” error on your PC.

## 6\. Reset the Licensing Status

This workaround involves resetting the activation period and [hiding the Activate Windows watermark](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/remove-activate-windows-10-watermark/) via Command Prompt.
