## Elevate Your Productivity: Enable a Search Bar on Win11's Taskbar

 Searching for processes and applications running on Windows using Task Manager can be tricky. To make it easier, Windows offers the option to enable the search box in Task Manager.

 This allows you to quickly search for any open application or process you need without having to scroll through all the items in the list. Although you'll need to download a third-party app to activate it, it's simple and easy. Here's how.

## How to Install the Task Manager Search Bar on Windows 11

 To enable the search box feature in your Task Manager, visit [ViVeTool's GitHub page](https://github.com/thebookisclosed/ViVe/releases/) and download ViVeTool-vx.x.x.zip. After downloading the zip file, extract its contents to your computer's **C:/ViVeTool** folder.

 Once done, [run the command prompt with administrator rights](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/). For this, [open the Run dialog box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) and type **cmd**, then press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** on your keyboard. If UAC asks you for permission, click **Yes**.

 When you're in the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following command and press Enter:

C:\vivetool\vivetool /enable /id:39420424

 This will install the tool on your system and throw a message that says, "Successfully set feature configuration (s)".

 Restart your computer to complete the installation process. After the restart, you should see a search box at the top of the task manager window.
