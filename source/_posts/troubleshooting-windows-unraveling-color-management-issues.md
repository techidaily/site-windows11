## Troubleshooting Windows: Unraveling Color Management Issues

 Color management on Windows is a process that helps you make sure the colors displayed on your screen are accurate and detailed. It involves calibrating your monitor and creating profiles according to the hardware and software that you have. The result of this calibration will give you close to natural colors on your screen.

 If you're having issues with colors on your Windows computer, it's likely due to a problem with color management. This guide will show you how to fix color management that has stopped working on Windows.

## 4\. Perform a Factory Reset

 The last resort is to perform a factory reset on Windows. A factory reset is when you delete everything on your computer and start from scratch. This is a good way to fix color management because it gets rid of any corrupt files that might be causing the problem.

 However, before you do a full reset, make sure to back up all of your important files. That way, you won't lose anything if something goes wrong during the process.
