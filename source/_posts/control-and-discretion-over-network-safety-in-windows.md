## Control and Discretion Over Network Safety in Windows

 Do you share your computer with someone else and not want them to access your Firewall & Network protection settings? If yes, then this is the place where you need to be.

 In this article, we'll see how you can hide or show the Firewall & Network protection settings area in Windows Security.

## Why It's Important to Hide the Firewall & Network Area in Windows Security

[Windows Security](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-quick-security-guide/) is your one-stop security center to protect your personal data and network settings. It is divided into different security sections for better and faster security management.

 One of these is the Firewall & Network protection area. This is where you can view the Microsoft Defender Firewall status and the type of networks your device is connected to. You can also use it to[block or allow an app through the firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/) and reset firewall settings.

 Therefore, keeping this area hidden is important, especially if you share your computer with someone else.
