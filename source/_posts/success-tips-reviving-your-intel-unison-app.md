## 4\. Turn Off Battery Saver Mode

 When you enable battery saver mode, Windows pauses background app activities on your computer. While this is a great way to[improve battery life on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-improve-battery-life/) , it may prevent apps like Intel Unison from working efficiently.

1. Press**Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. In the**System** tab, click on**Power & battery** .

## 5\. Disable Any Active Third-Party Antivirus Programs

 At times, third-party antivirus programs on your PC can get too cautious and prevent apps from exchanging files and syncing data. To check for this possibility, you need to temporarily disable your antivirus program.

 You can typically do this by right-clicking the antivirus program’s icon in the system tray and selecting**Disable until next restart** . However, the instructions will differ between antivirus programs, so if you're stuck, check your antivirus' official help documentation for instructions.

 Once disabled, try using the Intel Unison app again. If this solves your problem, you can go through your antivirus program’s settings and whitelist the Intel Unison app.

## 6\. Disconnect and Reconnect Your Phone

 Connection issues between the Intel Unison app and your phone can also cause the app to stop working on Windows. In most cases, you should be able to resolve such issues by disconnecting and reconnecting your phone.

 This should re-establish the connection between Windows and your phone, resolving any issues caused by misconfigured settings.

 To disconnect your phone from the Intel Unison app, follow these steps:

1. Open the Intel Unison app on your PC.
2. Click the**computer icon** in the top left corner and select**Manage my devices** .
3. Click the**Forget this device** option.
4. Next, open the Intel Unison app on your Android or iPhone and scan the QR code on your PC.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to pair your phone.
