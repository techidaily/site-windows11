## Taming Technology Troubles: Fixing Absentee Tab Functionality

 The Tab key on the keyboard generally allows you to move quickly from one field to the next when filling out forms or navigating websites. But sometimes you may notice that the Tab key is not working as expected. This can be really frustrating, especially if you rely on the Tab key for daily tasks.

 Read this guide to learn how to troubleshoot and fix the Tab key not working on Windows.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 If the Tab key on a keyboard is not working, the first and easiest thing to do is [restart your computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/). Sometimes, this can fix small glitches that could cause the issue. Before restarting your computer, save any open documents or work you have.

## 2\. Look for Physical Damage or Debris

 If the Tab key is physically damaged, it can affect its functionality. To ensure your Tab key functions correctly, disconnect your keyboard from your computer and check for any physical damage to the key. If damage is found, replace the Tab key. Also, if debris obstructs the keyboard mechanism, use compressed air to clear out dirt or dust.

 Wait for the troubleshooter to finish and follow any instructions it provides. If it fails to find any issues, move on to the next solution.

## 4\. Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter

 To run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter, do the following:

## 9\. Scan Your Computer for Malware

 Malware can sometimes interfere with the normal functioning of your keyboard and cause various issues, including this one. To ensure that your computer is free of malware, [scan for malicious programs](https://www.makeuseof.com/scan-for-viruses-without-buying-antivirus-software/). You can also use a [reputable antivirus software](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-antivirus-apps/) to scan for malware and remove any programs that might be causing your keyboard issues.

 Once you’ve done the scan, restart your computer, and see if the keyboard issue has been resolved. If not, you can continue troubleshooting with other methods.

## 9\. Use the On-Screen Keyboard

 If none of the above methods work to resolve your keyboard issue, try using the on-screen keyboard on Windows. It’s a virtual keyboard that allows you to input text without a physical keyboard. To access it, type **On-Screen Keyboard** into the Windows search bar and select the program.

 On-screen keyboard is an excellent way to test if your physical keyboard is the issue. If you can input text using the on-screen keyboard, but not with your physical one, you know the physical keyboard needs to be replaced.

## 10\. Perform Some General Fixes

 There are a few generic fixes available for this issue. [Run the System File Checker](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) command first to repair damaged or incorrect system files. This tool scans for corrupted files and replaces them with original versions.

 If you've downloaded or installed a program recently, it's possible that the installation process was not completed correctly and caused your keyboard issue.

 To check for this, you can [perform a clean boot](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/). This process starts up Windows with only basic drivers and services, allowing you to troubleshoot any software conflicts that may be causing the issue.
