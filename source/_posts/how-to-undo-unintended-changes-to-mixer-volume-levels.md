## How to Undo Unintended Changes to Mixer Volume Levels

 The Windows Volume Mixer is a great tool; it lets you manage audio outputs for different devices and adjust the volume for individual apps. But if the Volume Mixer doesn't save your audio settings, you might be stuck with an app that is too loud or playing through the wrong device.

 If this has happened to you, there’s no need to worry. We’ll walk you through the steps to fix the Volume Mixer and easily control your computer’s audio output.

## 1\. Run the Playing Audio Troubleshooter

 It might be hard to identify the exact cause of why Windows Volume Mixer can’t save audio settings. Before going through the list of more complicated fixes, try using Windows built-in tools to fix the issue. In this case, try running the Playing Audio troubleshooter.

1. Press**Win + I** to launch Windows Settings.
2. Click**System > Troubleshoot** .
3. Select**Other troubleshooters** .
4. From the**Most frequent** troubleshooters, click**Run** next to**Playing Audio** .

 Windows will now search for any possible problems regarding its playing audio capability. Once the process is complete, it will suggest one or more fixes that you can apply to make Volume Mixer save your audio settings.

## 2 Turn On Exclusive Mode

 Exclusive Mode allows apps to restrict your device’s audio control. In this case, it might help solve the Volume Mixer issue. Here’s how you can enable it:

1. Open Control Panel.
2. Set**Category** to**Large icons** or**Small icons** .
3. Select**Sound** .
4. From the**Playback** tab, select your output device and click**Properties** .
5. Open the**Advanced** tab.
6. Check the **Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device** and**Give exclusive mode application priority** options.
7. Click**Apply > OK** .

## 3\. Try Some Generic Windows Fixes

 If none of those did the job, there are some simple fixes you can do around Windows.

* There’s a chance that outdated or corrupt audio drivers are the reason why you can change your Volume Mixer settings. Fortunately, there are[multiple ways to update your audio drivers](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-audio-drivers-windows/) .
* If you’ve installed[sound-controlling apps to amplify your listening experience](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-sound-amplfication-apps/) , they might take control of your audio settings. You can try closing or uninstalling third-party apps to have Volume Mixer control the audio output.
* Additionally, you could[perform a clean boot](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) to check if there’s an installed app that manages your computer’s audio without you knowing about it.

## Control the Volume Mixer Again on Windows

 Not being able to adjust individual volumes can be really annoying, especially if you have multiple apps playing audio at the same time. We hope one or more of the above methods helped you fix the issue.
