## Unlocking Windows Safeguards Restricted by Admins

 Some users have reported they can’t set Windows Security options because of an error that says, “This setting is managed by your administrator.” Those users see that error message just above options within the**Virus & threat protection** and**App & browser tabs** of that app. Consequently, they can’t turn on important Windows Security settings there that are grayed out and disabled.

 That issue has little to do with admin rights. Many users who encounter the issue are already utilizing Windows administrator accounts. This is how you can fix the “setting is managed by your administrator” error in Windows 11.

## 1\. Check for and Install Available Windows 11 Updates

 Although not the most likely potential solution, some users have said installing available Windows 11 updates helped them resolve this error. Patchers for Windows 11 usually address Windows bugs reported by users.

 If you're not sure how to do this, visit[how to install Windows 11 updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-install-updates/) for a step-by-step guide.

## 2\. Reset the Windows Security and Settings Apps

 Users who’ve fixed the “setting is managed by your administrator” error have confirmed resetting the Windows Security and Settings apps can work. Resetting those apps will clear their data. You can reset Windows Security via Settings, as outlined in our[how to reset apps on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-reset-app/) guide.

![The Reset button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-reset-option.jpg)

 To reset Settings, you must open the Start menu and right-click the app’s shortcut. Select**App settings** to bring up some troubleshooting options for it. Then select the**Reset** troubleshooting option for the app.

## 3\. Uninstall Third-Party Antivirus Software

 Some third-party antivirus utilities can disable Windows Security features they effectively replace. If you’ve installed an overlapping third-party antivirus product, uninstalling it may resolve Windows Security’s administrator error. Uninstall antivirus software with a method within our guide on[how to remove Windows programs](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) to see if that resolves the issue.

![The uninstaller tool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-uninstaller-tool.jpg)

 Should this solution work, the issue will likely reoccur if you reinstall the same third-party antivirus virus software. Then you would have to choose between using the third-party antivirus utility or Windows Security.

## 4\. Edit the Registry

 Many users have been able to fix the Windows Security administrator error by applying this confirmed registry solution. This registry tweak involves modifying a DWORD value, but you don’t need to delete any key. To apply this potential resolution, edit the registry like this:

1. Run the Windows Registry Editor app, which you can open with any method included in our[how to open Regedit](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-registry-editor/) [g](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-registry-editor/) uide.
2. Click inside the address box at the top of Registry Editor and erase the text in it.
3. Input this key path in the registry address bar and press**Return** :  
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard\Scenarios\HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity`
4. Then double-click the**Enabled** DWORD within the**HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity** key.  
![The HypervisorEnforced registry key](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-hypervisor-key.jpg)
5. Clear the**Data value** box, and then input**0** there.
