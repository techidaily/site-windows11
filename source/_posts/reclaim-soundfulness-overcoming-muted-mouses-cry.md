## Reclaim Soundfulness: Overcoming Muted Mouse's Cry

 The spacebar on the keyboard generally creates space between words, but sometimes you may notice that pressing it turns down the volume. If so, this can be a frustrating experience, especially when you need to type something urgently.

 So, we'll guide you through the solutions to help you fix the issue of your spacebar turning down the volume on Windows 11.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 If your spacebar has suddenly started to turn down the volume on your Windows 11, one of the first solutions you should try is restarting your computer.

 It refreshes all programs and processes running in the background while clearing out any software conflicts that may be causing the issue. So, give it a try and check if that solves the problem.

## 2\. Tweak the Keyboard Settings

 If your spacebar continues to turn down the volume even after restarting your computer, you should consider tweaking your keyboard settings. A few adjustments in the Control Panel may do the trick and restore the spacebar. Here is how you can do it:

1. Open the Control Panel. If you need help, see our guide on[how to open the Control Panel on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-control-panel/) .
2. Then go to**Ease of Access** \>**Make the Keyboard easier to use** .
3. Uncheck the boxes next to**Turn on Sticky Keys** and**Turn on Filter Keys** .

4. Now click on**Apply** and**OK** .

 Once you've completed the above steps, close the window and try pressing the spacebar again to check if it is back to its normal functioning.

## 3\. Check for Third-Party Software

 If third-party software on your computer is interfering with the spacebar, then it needs to be identified and uninstalled. To do this, follow the below instructions:

1. Press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** on your keyboard to open the Task Manager.
2. Go to the**Processes** tab and see if any suspicious apps are causing the issue.
3. Once you've identified the software, close the window and[open the System Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
4. In the Settings menu, go to**Apps > Installed apps** .
5. Now scroll down to that faulty application, click on three dots, and select**Uninstall** from the option list.
6. Click**Uninstall** again if a pop-up menu appears and asks for confirmation.

 After uninstalling it, restart your computer and test the spacebar to see if it is fixed.

## 4\. Run SFC Scan and DISM Tool

 Corrupted or missing system files can sometimes cause the spacebar to decrease the volume. If this is really what's happening, running System File Checker (SFC) and Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) scans should help solve it.

 To learn more about these powerful tools, see our guide on[how to repair corrupt Windows files with Windows' built-in tools](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/) .

## 5\. Update the Keyboard Driver

 Sometimes an outdated or corrupted keyboard driver may also cause this issue. To be sure it's not the case, you must check for any available updates to your keyboard drivers. Here's how you can do it:

1. Press**Win + X** on your keyboard and select**Device Manager** from the menu.
2. In the Device Manager window, locate the**Keyboards** section and then expand it.
3. Right-click the keyboard driver and choose**Update driver** from the context menu.  
![Update the Keyboard driver](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/update-the-keyboard-driver.jpg)
4. Next, select**Search automatically for drivers** and let Windows search for the latest version of the driver.  
![Search automatically for drivers](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/search-automatically-for-drivers.jpg)

 Once it's done, restart your computer and check if the spacebar has stopped turning down the volume.

 You could also try reinstalling the keyboard driver if the issue remains unresolved. To do this, right-click on the Keyboard driver and select**Uninstall device** from the menu that appears. After that, restart your computer, and Windows will automatically reinstall the updated driver.

## 6\. Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter

 Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter is a reliable troubleshooting tool for detecting keyboard issues. This powerful program can identify and fix a wide range of problemsâ€”from outdated drivers to potential hardware conflicts, which could result in your spacebar decreasing the volume.

To run this troubleshooter, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on Start and select**Run** from the menu list.
2. In the Run dialog box, type "**msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic** " and click**OK** .
3. The Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter will now open. Click**Next** to begin the scan.  
![Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/run-the-hardware-and-devices-troubleshooter.jpg)
4. Wait for it to finish and apply any recommended fixes that it finds.

 Once done, restart your computer and check if the spacebar is now functioning properly.

## 7\. Run the Keyboard Troubleshooter

 If the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter didn't work, you should consider running the Keyboard troubleshooter. This is another built-in utility that can help you solve any type of input device issue. Here's how to use it:

1. Right-click on Start and select**Settings** from the menu list.
2. In the Settings menu, choose**System > Troubleshoot** .
3. Then click**Other troubleshooters** on the next page.
4. Scroll down to**Keyboard** , then click the**Run** option.  
![Run the Keyboard Troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/run-the-keyboard-troubleshooter.jpg)

 Wait for the troubleshooter to detect any issues with your keyboard. If it finds something wrong, follow the instructions on the screen to fix the problem.

## 8\. Check for Windows Update

 After you've gone through all the steps above and still experience the issue, chances are that your Windows version is outdated and needs updating. Installing the latest update can fix your spacebar not working properly.

To download and install the Windows Update, do the following:

1. Press**Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.
2. Select**Windows Update** from the left pane.
3. Now click the**Check for updates** button to let Windows search for available updates.  
![Check for Updates](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/check-for-updates.jpg)

 If you find any, download and install it. After that, restart your computer and check if it solves the issue.

## 9\. Perform a System Restore

 If nothing else works, then you can always perform a System Restore. This will roll back your system to when the spacebar is working properly.

 To learn more about System Restore, see our detailed guide on[how to use a restore point to restore your Windows 11 System](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) .

## Stop the Keyboard Spacebar From Interfering With Your Computer's Volume

 After you've gone through all these steps, your keyboard should already start working fine. But if not, try using another keyboard if you have one handy. Although unlikely, the issue could be hardware-based. If so, your best recourse is to get a new keyboard.
