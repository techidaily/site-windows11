## Solutions for Rearranged Characters in Windows OS

 It can be confusing if your keyboard on Windows starts typing backward instead of typing in the typical left-to-right manner. Not only does it hinder your ability to write comfortably, but it can also lead to mistakes, especially when entering sensitive information such as passwords.

 Thankfully, you don’t have to endure such behavior, as this guide contains some effective solutions that can prevent the keyboard from typing backward on your Windows computer.

## 1\. Use the CTRL + Left Shift Keyboard Shortcut to Change the Typing Direction

 Some Windows computers have macros that can change the typing direction from left to right. This is one of the most common reasons why your keyboard may start typing from right to left on Windows. If this is the case, simply press **Ctrl + Right Shift** on your keyboard to change the typing direction back to left to right.

 Several users on a [Microsoft Community post](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-to-stop-keyboard-from-typing-in-reverse/a766f453-0ef3-4aaa-8690-76ee9e86729c)reported fixing the problem with this trick. Note that if you accidentally press the **Ctrl + Left Shift** key, Windows will start typing in reverse again.

## 2\. Check Region Settings

 Setting your Windows computer to the wrong region may not seem like a big deal, but it can cause a number of problems, including the one mentioned here. Hence, it's a good idea to double-check the region settings on your Windows PC and make sure they are correct.

 To do so, perform these steps:

1. Press **Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. Navigate to **Time & language > Language & region**.
3. Click the drop-down menu next to **Country or region** and select the appropriate option.
4. Similarly, set the correct **Regional format** as well.

## 3\. Run the Relevant Windows Troubleshooters

 If your keyboard types backward even after correcting the region settings, you can get help from the [built-in troubleshooters on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-troubleshooters/). In this case, you can run the dedicated keyboard troubleshooter to see if it can fix the problem.

 To run the keyboard troubleshooter on Windows:

1. Press **Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. In the **System** tab, click on **Troubleshoot**.
3. Click on **Other troubleshooters**.
4. Click the **Run** button next to **Keyboard** and follow the on-screen prompts to finish the troubleshooting process.

 If the issue persists, you can run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. As this tool is unavailable in the Settings app, you must use the Run dialog box to access it. Here's how to do that:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic** in the text field and press **Enter**.
3. In the Hardware and Devices window, click **Advanced** and tick the **Apply repairs automatically** checkbox.
4. Click **Next** to run the troubleshooter.

 Allow the troubleshooter to find and fix any problems, and check if the issue still occurs.

## 4\. Update or Reinstall Your Keyboard Drivers

 Outdated or incompatible keyboard drivers on your computer can also cause this unusual behavior. You can try updating the keyboard driver on your computer to see if it stops Windows from typing backward.

 We have a comprehensive guide on [how to locate and replace outdated drivers on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/find-replace-outdated-windows-drivers/). Refer to it to update the keyboard drivers on your PC and then check if the issue persists. If it does, the keyboard driver may be damaged or corrupted. In that case, you will need to [fix the corrupted driver](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-corrupt-drivers-on-windows-10/) by reinstalling it on your PC.

## 5\. Check for Stuck Keys or Use a Different Keyboard

![Arrow Keys on Keyboard](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/arrow-keys-on-keyboard.jpg)

 It's possible that the left arrow key on your keyboard is stuck, which is why Windows is typing in reverse. Try using the left arrow key in another program to see if the issue persists. If it does, you may need to clean the key or remove and reinsert it.

 Alternatively, you can also try using a different keyboard if one is available.

## Bring Backward Typing to a Full Stop on Windows

 Such keyboard issues on Windows can be frustrating, but they are usually easy to fix. We hope that one of the above tips has stopped your keyboard from typing backward on Windows and you can now write comfortably.

 Thankfully, you don’t have to endure such behavior, as this guide contains some effective solutions that can prevent the keyboard from typing backward on your Windows computer.
