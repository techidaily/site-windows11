 SHAREit is a peer-to-peer file-sharing app that will help you transfer your files. While the app is famous and known to many Android users, it can also help you to share your files from one PC to another. A slew of features made us pick this tool for this guide:

3. Enables you to transfer files between your phone and computer.
4. Transfer your files over hotspots.

It can transfer large files from one device to another without any interruptions or breaks—it relies on the internet for this and doesn’t put any limit on file size.

 You can give the free version of the app a go first, which does come with some understandable limits, and see if it helps you. If you like the free version, you can pick from various paid options.
