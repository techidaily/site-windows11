 Feem is the best offline file transfer tool in this list. It can transfer large files from one device to another without any interruptions or breaks—it relies on the internet for this and doesn’t put any limit on file size. The app is available for major platforms, and while the Feem app is definitely a handy tool, you can also use the web app version, which will help you transfer your files simply from your browser.

 You can give the free version of the app a go first, which does come with some understandable limits, and see if it helps you. If you like the free version, you can pick from various paid options.

**Download:** [Feem](https://feem.io/#features) (Free, $9.99/yr)
