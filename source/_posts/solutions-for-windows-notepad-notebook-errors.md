## Solutions for Windows Notepad Notebook Errors

 Notepad is a simple text editor that has been part of the Windows operating system since its inception. Unfortunately, even after years of improvements and updates, Notepad is not immune to occasional crashes.

 If the Notepad app is constantly closing or crashing on your Windows 10 or 11 PC, don’t fret. Here are some tips that should help fix the problem.

 This may sound odd, but several users on [Microsoft Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/notepad-is-closing-automatically-windows-11-home/fc1a1f61-40ed-48ec-be84-1133a40e25dc) reported fixing Notepad crashes by simply resizing the app window.

 To resize the Notepad window, click the **Restore Down** button in the top right corner. Then, move your mouse cursor over the edge of the window and click and hold the left mouse button. Drag the window to the desired size and see if that resolves the issue.
