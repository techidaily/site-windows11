## Balancing Audio Dynamics for Bluetooth Devices

 Bluetooth speakers have become increasingly popular recently, and there's a good reason behind it. They allow you to enjoy your favorite music without being tethered to a device. However, if you're using a Bluetooth speaker with a Windows PC, you might have trouble controlling the volume.

 This can be irritating, especially when you can't control the volume when it is too low or too high. Fortunately, you can try various fixes when Bluetooth speaker volume control is not working in Windows 11.

## 1\. Try Basic Repairs

 Before changing any important Windows settings, re-pair the Bluetooth speaker and check if it makes any difference. Oftentimes, the Bluetooth speaker or its volume controller stops working due to a temporary glitch in the Bluetooth speaker. To eliminate that glitch, re-pair your Bluetooth device. Here's how:

1. Press the**Win + I** key to launch the**Settings app.**
2. Choose the**Bluetooth & devices** option from the left sidebar.
3. Click the**three dots** (...) in the top right corner of the Bluetooth speaker you want to remove.
4. Choose**Remove device** option from the context menu and click**Yes** to confirm your selection.  
![Remove device option in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/remove-device-option.jpg)
5. Wait a few seconds, then click the**Add a device** tile.
6. Choose**Bluetooth.**  
![Add a device option in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/add-a-device-option.jpg)
7. Select your Bluetooth speaker and then click on the**Done** button to exit the window.

[Restating your computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) is also a great way to eliminate bugs and glitches that might be causing the issue. To restart your Windows PC, press the**Alt + F4** hokey, choose**Restart** from the drop-down menu, and click OK.

## 2\. Run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter

 Facing issues with your Bluetooth speaker on a Windows PC is common. Fortunately, you can fix most of such problems using the Bluetooth troubleshooter. Here's how to run it:

1. Open the**Settings app** using the**Win + I** hotkeys.
2. Choose**System** from the left sidebar and**Troubleshoot** option from the right pane.
3. Select**Other troubleshooters.**
4. Click the**Run** button next to**Bluetooth.**  
![Run button of Bluetooth troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/run-button.jpg)
5. In the**Get Help** window that crops up, click**Yes** to give your consent to run automated diagnostics to fix your Bluetooth issue.  
![Yes option of the Bluetooth Troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/yes-option.jpg)

 That's it! The Bluetooth troubleshooter will detect and fix issues automatically. Once the process is complete, restart your system and check if the Bluetooth speaker volume controller is working.

## 3\. Choose Your Bluetooth Speaker as Default Audio Device

 It's important to properly configure the Bluetooth speaker on your Windows PC. If it is not set as the default device to play audio, you'll likely experience various Bluetooth issues, including the one at hand.

 So, set the Bluetooth speaker as your Windows PC's default audiooption. You can do that by following the below instructions:

1. Launch the Settings app, choose**System** from the left sidebar, and**Sound** from the right pane.
2. Click**More sound settings** under the**Advanced** section.  
![More sound settings option in the Sound setting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/more-sound-settings.jpg)
3. Select your Bluetooth speaker and click the**Set default** button. Then, click**OK** to save the changes.

## 4\. Update Your Bluetooth Driver

 Drivers become outdated with time. Using an outdated driver can pose issues and thus affect the normal functioning of the device. So, it is a great idea to update your Bluetooth driver to the latest version.

Follow these steps to download the latest Bluetooth driver update:

1. Launch the**Device Manager** (see how to[open Device Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-device-manager/) ) and expand the Bluetooth node.
2. Right-click on the Bluetooth adapter and choose the**Update driver** option.  
![Update driver option in the Device Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/update-driver.jpg)
3. Choose**Search automatically for driver** option.

 Now, wait till the utility looks for and downloads any available driver update. However, if Windows fails to detect any new driver update, search on your Bluetooth adapter manufacturer's website for a new driver.

## 5\. Reinstall Bluetooth Driver

 If downloading the latest Bluetooth driver update wasn't helpful, try reinstalling the drivers. That way, your computer will[remove all the corrupt drivers](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-corrupt-drivers-on-windows-10/) and auto-download and install the befitting drivers.

 Here's how to reinstall the Bluetooth driver using the Device Manager:

1. Launch the Device Manager, and expand the Bluetooth node.
2. Right-click on the Bluetooth adapter and choose the**Uninstall Device** option.
3. Click**Uninstall** again to confirm your selection.  
![Uninstall option in the Device Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/uninstall-option.jpg)

 Next, restart your computer and pair the Bluetooth device again. Upon pairing, Windows will auto-download the latest drivers.

## 6\. Restart Bluetooth Support Service

 Bluetooth Support Service is an important Windows service that is responsible for the proper functioning of Bluetooth speakers. If this service is not running or has been affected by a temporary bug, you'll encounter the Bluetooth speaker volume controller not working issue.

 To fix that, you'll have to restart the Bluetooth Support Service. Here's how:

1. Press the**Win + R** key to open the**Run tool.**
2. Type**services.msc** in the search bar and click**OK.**
3. Select**Bluetooth** **Support Service** and click the**Restart** option in the left sidebar.  
![Bluetooth Support Service in the Service window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bluetooth-support-service.jpg)
4. Click**Yes** to the confirmation box that crops up.

## 7\. Turn Off Absolute Volume

 Absolute Volume is an incredible Windows feature that lets you effectively manage the volume of your Bluetooth speaker. But, for various reasons, it might start malfunctioning and prevent you from adjusting the volume.

 The solution, in this case, is to disable Absolute Volume on your Windows PC. You can do that by following these steps:

 Disabling Absolute Volume can be risky as it requires editing the registry. So, make sure to[create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) and[back up the registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before trying the below steps.

1. Launch the Run dialog box, type**regedit** , and click OK.
2. Navigate to the following location:  
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Bluetooth\Audio\AVRCP\CT`
3. Right-click on the**CT folder** in the left sidebar, hover the cursor to**New,** and choose**DWORD (32-bit) Value** .  
![DWORD (32-bit) Value in the Registry Editor](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dword-32-bit-value.jpg)
4. Right-click the newly created value in the right pane, and choose**Rename** from the context menu.
5. Name the value**DisableAbsoluteVolume** and press Enter.
6. Double-click on the DisbaleAbsoluteVolume value in the right pane.
7. Type**1** in the**Value data** section and click**OK.**  
![Value data of DisableAbsoluteVolume value](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/value-data.jpg)

 Restart your system, and you'll see you are no longer facing the issue.

## Bluetooth Speaker Volume Control Not Working, Fixed

 These are all the fixes you can try when the Bluetooth speaker volume controller is not working in Windows 11\. Restarting the computer and re-pairing the Bluetooth device usually does the trick. However, if that doesn't work, try troubleshooting the drivers, restarting important services, and updating drivers.
