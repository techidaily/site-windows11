## Mastering Access: Steps for Unlocking Windows' Hidden Char Personality Tracker

 The Private Character Editor is a Microsoft Windows program that lets you create, edit, and manage custom fonts. You can use this tool to create symbols and other characters that are not included in the standard Windows character set.
