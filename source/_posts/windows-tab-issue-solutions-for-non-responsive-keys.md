## 4\. Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter

 If the Keyboard troubleshooter fails to resolve the issue, you can try running the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. This program will scan for hardware-related problems and offer solutions to fix them.

 To run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter, do the following:

1. [Run Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/).
2. In the Command Prompt window, **type msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic** and press Enter.  
![Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/run-the-hardware-and-devices-troubleshooter.jpg)

## 6\. Reinstall the Keyboard Driver

 If the keyboard driver fails to update, you can reinstall it. This will overwrite any existing files and could solve the issue.

 To do so, follow these steps:

 Once your system is back online, Windows will automatically detect and reinstall the keyboard driver. Check if this solves the Tab key problem.

## 7\. Disable the Sticky and Filter Keys

 The Sticky and Filter Keys are accessibility features of Microsoft Windows, but sometimes they interfere with the normal functioning of other keys on your keyboard. So, try disabling both these features to see if they are causing the problem with the Tab key on your keyboard.

2. On the Settings menu, click the **Accessibility** tab
3. Scroll down to the **Interaction** section and click on the **Keyboard**.

2. In the **Processes** tab, locate **TeamViewer** and right-click on it.

## 9\. Scan Your Computer for Malware

 Malware can sometimes interfere with the normal functioning of your keyboard and cause various issues, including this one. To ensure that your computer is free of malware, [scan for malicious programs](https://www.makeuseof.com/scan-for-viruses-without-buying-antivirus-software/). You can also use a [reputable antivirus software](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-antivirus-apps/) to scan for malware and remove any programs that might be causing your keyboard issues.

 Once you’ve done the scan, restart your computer, and see if the keyboard issue has been resolved. If not, you can continue troubleshooting with other methods.

## 9\. Use the On-Screen Keyboard

 If none of the above methods work to resolve your keyboard issue, try using the on-screen keyboard on Windows. It’s a virtual keyboard that allows you to input text without a physical keyboard. To access it, type **On-Screen Keyboard** into the Windows search bar and select the program.

 On-screen keyboard is an excellent way to test if your physical keyboard is the issue. If you can input text using the on-screen keyboard, but not with your physical one, you know the physical keyboard needs to be replaced.

## 10\. Perform Some General Fixes

 There are a few generic fixes available for this issue. [Run the System File Checker](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) command first to repair damaged or incorrect system files. This tool scans for corrupted files and replaces them with original versions.

 If you've downloaded or installed a program recently, it's possible that the installation process was not completed correctly and caused your keyboard issue.

 To check for this, you can [perform a clean boot](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/). This process starts up Windows with only basic drivers and services, allowing you to troubleshoot any software conflicts that may be causing the issue.
