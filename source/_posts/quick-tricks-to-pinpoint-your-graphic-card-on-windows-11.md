## Quick Tricks to Pinpoint Your Graphic Card on Windows 11

 The graphics processing unit (GPU) plays an integral part in your overall Windows experience, all the way from gaming to video editing. A high-performing graphic card can be a key deciding factor in your user experience.

 You may know all of the significant graphic card manufacturers, such as AMD, Nvidia, Intel, and ASUS... but what model is your GPU, exactly? Here's how to check your graphics card model on a Windows 11 PC.

## 1\. How to Check Your Graphics Card Model via Windows 11's Task Manager

 The Task Manager was redesigned in Windows 11 and now boasts a sleek interface that complements its functionality. While users typically use the Task Manager to keep track of running applications and services, you can also use it to figure out your graphic card model name and specs.

To check the installed graphics card or GPU of your Windows 11 PC:

1. Right-click the**Start** menu and select**Task Manager.**
2. From the side menu, choose**Performance** and then**GPU 0** . If you have more than one GPU installed, you’ll see them labeled**GPU 1, GPU 2** , etc. Alternatively, if you don’t know any**GPU** option, it's possible you may not have a graphics card on your system, or you may not have configured it correctly.

3. The Task Manager window will list the name of your graphics card in the top right corner. You can also find the**Driver** and**DirectX** versions in the bottom right corner.
