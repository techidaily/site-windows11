## Enhance Typing Speed: Mastering Windows' PowerTools

 With lots to pack into a day, it's always good to find shortcuts or solutions that could speed up your work. One way to get things done faster on Windows is by reducing your typing time with Microsoft PowerToys.

 PowerToys has a few utilities like the Keyboard Manager, Quick Accent, and Shortcut Guide to help you speed up your typing.

## What Is PowerToys? How Can You Get It?

 Developed by Microsoft in collaboration with its community, PowerToys is a suite of open-source utilities you can install on your Windows 10 or 11 PC. With PowerToys, you can customize your Windows experience and enhance your productivity and efficiency.

 PowerToys was launched with Windows 95 and included a utility that enabled users to auto-play CDs. Today, PowerToys comprises many innovative tools, including one that lets you[extract text from images](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-powertoys-extract-text-images/) and another that[converts your cursor into a handy color picker](https://www.makeuseof.com/powertoys-color-picker-guide/) .

 It's easy to get PowerToys on your PC—look it up in the Microsoft Store and install it or download it from its[PowerToys Microsoft Store page](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-powertoys/XP89DCGQ3K6VLD) .

 Once you have PowerToys, you can use the Keyboard Manager, Quick Accent, and Shortcut Guide to type faster. Remember that PowerToys must be activated and running in the background for these utilities to work.

![Keyboard Manager Settings in PowerToys](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/keyboard-manager-settings-powertoys.jpg)
4. Press the**down arrow** under the**Type** button in the**Physical Key** section, and select a key like**P** . Then under the**Mapped to** section, click on the**down arrow** under**Type** and select a key like**S** to map the physical key.  
![P Key Remapped to Key S in Remap Keys Window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/remap-keyp-to-keys.jpg)
5. Finally, click on the blue**OK** button on top and click on**Continue Anyway** on the warning prompt. Now when you type P on your keyboard, the letter S will get typed.

 Remapping a key is also handy if a key stops functioning. You can map it to another key till you get the faulty key fixed or buy a new keyboard.

 You can also map shortcuts like Ctrl + I to a key. Click on the**plus sign** under**Physical Key.** Then click on the**Type** button. Next, select a key like**F1** by pressing it on the keyboard. Then click**OK** .

 Now under the**Mapped to** section, click on the**Type** button. Now press**Ctrl + I** or the Italicize shortcut on the keyboard to map the**F1** key to it.

![F1 Key Remapped to Ctrl + I Shortcut](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/remap-key-to-shortcut.jpg)

 Now, when you need to italicize a text, instead of Ctrl + I, just press a single key, F1\. So you'll automatically be typing faster.

 This way, you could remap many alphabet and number keys, and even function keys to speed up your work. Think of all the milliseconds and seconds you will save whenever you type.

### How to Remap Shortcuts to Type Faster

 Below the**Remap a key** option you'll find the**Remap a shortcut** option. Click on it to open**Remap shortcuts** window. You can remap common shortcuts to other shortcuts you prefer to use.

 For example, instead of pressing**Ctrl + B** keys to make a text bold, you'd rather use**Shift (left) + Z** —Shift (left) + Z keys are next to each other and easier and faster to press together. So in the**Remap Shortcuts** window, type**Shift (left) + Z** under**Physical Shortcut** and**Ctrl + B** under the**Mapped to** section.

 You can choose**All Apps** as the Target App or an app such as**Word** , where you want this remapped shortcut to work. But remember to put the executable name or**EXE name** of the Word app, which is**Winword** . You can easily find the EXE names of apps via a Google search.

![Shift + Z Physical Shortcut Mapped to Ctrl + B Shortcut](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/remap-shortcuts-powertoys.jpg)

 Finally, click on the blue**OK** button and click**Continue Anyway** on the prompt.

 Now you can bold text with your preferred shortcut and type faster on your favorite app.

## How to Type Accents in a Snap With Quick Accent

 There could be times when you need to add an accented character while typing. Maybe while sharing the name of your exotic holiday destination or ensuring the surname of a guest is spelled right.

 With Quick Accents, you could do that in a snap while typing with your English keyboard. Yes, it's easy to use this fast way to type accented characters.

 In PowerToys Settings, click on**Quick Accent** in the left pane and toggle on**Enable Quick Accent** . You can use the**Left** ,**Right Arrows** , or**Space** as the**Activation key** .

 Under**Characters** ,**Choose a character set** you want to use, like Catalan, Dutch, French, German, Spanish, and more. Or choose**All available** to get all the options.

![Quick Accent Settings in PowerToys](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/quick-accent-settings-powertoys.jpg)

 To use Quick Accent, first press and hold the key of the character on which you want to add an accent. Then press the Activation Key.

 For example, if you want to use the accented character**ü** to type**München** , the German name of Munich—press and hold the**u** key and then press the**spacebar,** or the**left or right arrow keys** . A toolbar of accented characters for the letter**u** will appear on your PC screen.

![Toolbar of Accented Characters for the U Key on Screen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/munich-umlaut-quick-accent-1.jpg)

 Move across the toolbar with the**spacebar** or the**left or right arrow keys** to highlight the**ü** accented character. Then release the**u** key on your keyboard—and**ü** will get typed.

![Shortcut Guide Settings in PowerToys](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/shortcut-guide-settings-powertoys.jpg)

 While typing, activate the Shortcut Guide. An overlay will appear on your screen displaying keyboard shortcuts that use the Win key. You'll also see the result of each shortcut written in the guide.

![Shortcut Guide Overlay in PowerToys](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/shortcut-guide-overlay-powertoys.jpg)

 You can use the shortcuts while the guide is displayed. So if you're holding the**Win** key, just press a letter like**E** —that would become**Win + E** and open up File Explorer. Release the Win key to close the overlay.

 If you've used a shortcut key combination for activation, the guide will stay displayed on the screen. So first enter the Win key, then another key to apply a shortcut.

 Once done, press the shortcut key combination again to close the guide overlay.
