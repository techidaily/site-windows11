## Fast-Forwarding Copy & Paste: Custom Hotkeys for Text Snaps in Win11

 While copy-pasting on a PC is a handy tool to have on hand, the Windows clipboard doesn’t enable users to create custom hotkeys for pasting pre-defined text snippets.

 QuickTextPaste and HotkeyP are third-party Windows apps with which you can set up alternative custom hotkeys for pasting text snippets. This is how you can create unique hotkeys for pasting addresses, names, numbers, and other text snippets you’ll often need to input into word processors or browsers with those apps.

## How to Set Up Hotkeys for Pasting Pre-Defined Text With QuickTextPaste

 QuickTextPaste is freeware software for Windows 11, 10, 8.1, and 7\. It’s a lightweight program that enables you to set up and save custom[hotkeys](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-a-hotkey-how-to-make-custom/) with which you can always paste pre-defined text whenever needed. Plus, you can set custom hotkeys for opening apps with that software. You can set up a hotkey for pasting pre-defined text with QuickTextPaste as follows:

1. Open[this QuickTextPaste](https://www.softwareok.com/?Download=QuickTextPaste) download page.
2. Click the**QuickTextPaste\_x64.zip** download link.
3. Press the**Windows** logo +**E** keyboard buttons to open the file manager and go to the directory the QuickTextPaste ZIP downloaded.
4. Follow the steps in this guide about[unzipping files within Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/) to extract the QuickTextPaste archive.  
![The Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders tool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/extract-compressed-window.jpg)
5. Double-click**QuickTextPaste\_x64.exe** to run QuickTextPaste.
6. Now input some text you want to set up a custom paste hotkey for within the**Add** **text** box.  
![The QuickTextPaste window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/the-quicktextpaste-window.jpg)
7. Select the keys to include within your hotkey on the two drop-down menus at the bottom of the QuickTextPaste window.
8. Press the**Add** button. You should see your new hotkey listed within the Keyboard Shortcuts column.

 You can now try out your new custom paste hotkey. Click QuickTextPaste’s**To-Tray** button to minimize the app to the system tray area. Open Notepad, or any other text editor or word processor, to paste in. Then press whatever custom hotkey you set up to paste in its predefined text snippet.

 To set up some program hotkeys, input**run: <application file name>** within the**Add** text box. For example, input**run: msedge.exe** to set up an Edge hotkey. Select the key combination for running the software in the drop-down menus.

![A run Edge hotkey](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/run-edge-hotkey.jpg)

 QuickTextPaste has a 4,000-character limit for text snippets. However, that’s not an especially big restriction. You can probably fit up to 600 words within a 4,000-character limit.

 QuickTextPaste needs to be running in the background for its hotkeys to work. You can set the program to run automatically by clicking**Action** \>**Start** **with Windows** . Select the**Always start minimized (ToTray)** option to set the program to appear only in the system tray area when started.

 Now you’ll see the hotkey you’ve just set listed within the HotkeyP window. Press**Esc** to hide the HotkeyP in the system tray. Then open WordPad, Notepad, or another text editor to try out the hotkey. Press the custom hotkey you’ve set up to paste in its pre-defined text.

 When you need to modify a hotkey or its text, select it in HotkeyP and click**Edit** . Then you can adjust the parameter and key configuration within the Hot Key window again. To remove a hotkey, select a keyboard shortcut and click**Delete** .

 You can configure general settings for HotkeyP by clicking**Window** \>**Options** . The**Start automatically at Windows startup** checkbox is already selected by default on the**General** tab. That tab also includes options for adding/removing buttons in the main window, setting buttons for hiding the window and showing the program in the system tray among others.

To do so, click the**arrow (<)** button and**System** on the Hot Key window to choose one of those hotkey functions.

![The System hotkey options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/system-hotkey-options.jpg)

There you can select**Always on Top** ,**Maximize window** ,**Minimize others** ,**Window snapshot,** **Close window** , and**Opacity** hotkey options, to name a few.

 You can set up a program keyboard shortcut by selecting an app’s path within the Hot Key window.
