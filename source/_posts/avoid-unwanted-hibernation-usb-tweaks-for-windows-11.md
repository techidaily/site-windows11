## Avoid Unwanted Hibernation - USB Tweaks for Windows 11

 Windows' USB selective suspend feature puts USB devices in a low-power state when not in use. While this can enhance battery life, it may cause problems with peripherals that require constant power.

 If you encounter issues with USB devices on your Windows 11 computer, consider disabling the USB selective suspend feature. Here’s how to do so on Windows 11\.
