## Ending System Crashes: Fix for Code 0X0000011B Errors

 A new security patch released by Microsoft may have caused printers shared over the network to malfunction, resulting in the operation failed 0x0000011B error. The error has primarily affected Windows 10 21H1 build running computers. However, you may also experience it on Windows 11 systems.
