 A new security patch released by Microsoft may have caused printers shared over the network to malfunction, resulting in the operation failed 0x0000011B error. The error has primarily affected Windows 10 21H1 build running computers. However, you may also experience it on Windows 11 systems.

 You can fix the error by installing the latest patch for the bug in the Windows update section. If not, here are other troubleshooting steps to fix the error and get your printer working again.

 Note that all the fixes must be applied to the host system that has the printer connected to it.

## 1\. Restart the Print Spooler Service

 A common troubleshooting step to fix issues with your printer is to restart the print spooler service. It is an essential service that handles the print job between your computer and printer.

## 4\. Disable the CVE-2021-1678 Registry Fix

 The problematic security update included a security fix to patch the Printer Spooler Spoofing vulnerability dubbed CVE-2021-1678\. However, the new changes seem to have triggered the 0x0000011B operation failed error.

 To fix the error without uninstalling the security update, you’ll need to create a new registry entry to disable the feature. Here’s how to do it.

 Note that modifying your Windows Registry involves risk. We recommend you[back up your Windows registry](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) and[create a system restore](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) before proceeding with the steps below.

Next, follow these steps to disable CVE-2021-1678 mitigation:

1. Press**Win + R** to open**Run** .
2. Type**regedit** and click**OK** to open Registry Editor.
3. In Registry Editor, navigate to the following location. Copy and paste the registry path for quick navigation:  
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print`
4. Next, right-click on**Print > New > DWORD (32-bit) Value.**  
![create new dword 32 bit value registry editor](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/create-new-dword-32-bit-value-registry-editor.jpg)
5. Rename the**DWORD value** as**RpcAuthnLevelPrivacyEnabled.**  
![registry editor modify rpcauthlevelprivacyenabled](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/registry-editor-modify-rpcauthlevelprivacyenabled.jpg)
6. Right-click on the**RpcAuthnLevelPrivacyEnabled** value and select**Modify** .
7. Type**0** in the**Value data** field and click**OK** to save the changes.  
![registry editor modify rpcauthlevelprivacyenabled 0 disabled](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/registry-editor-modify-rpcauthlevelprivacyenabled-0-disabled.jpg)
8. Close**Registry Editor** and restart your PC to apply the changes.
9. After the restart, try to use your shared printer and check if the error is resolved.

## 5\. Uninstall Recently Installed Updates

 Assuming the issue is triggered after you installed a Windows security update, uninstalling the update should undo the changes and fix the error. You can uninstall some individual updates from the Windows updates section. This feature is specifically available to undo issues that may have occurred after installing an update.

 Note that the concerned update (KB5005565) was released to fix a print spooler vulnerability on Windows OS. Uninstalling the update can leave your computer vulnerable again. Use this as a last resort if none of the above methods helped resolve the error.

To uninstall Windows updates:

1. Press**Win + R** to open**Run** .
2. Type**control** and click**OK** to open**Control Panel.**  
![control panel uninstall programs](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/control-panel-uninstall-programs.jpg)

![control panel uninstall programs view installed updatges](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/control-panel-uninstall-programs-view-installed-updatges.jpg)
4. Click on**View installed updates** under**Programs and Features** . This will open the**Uninstall updates** section in the**Settings** app. Alternatively, go to **Settings > Windows Update > Update history > Uninstall updates** to access the same.  
![uninstall windows updates](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/uninstall-windows-updates.jpg)
5. Locate the problematic update (**KB5005565**) and click on**Uninstall** .
6. Click**Uninstall** again to confirm the action. Wait for the update to uninstall and restart your PC to apply the changes.

## Fixing the 0x0000011b Printing Error on Windows

 This error has largely affected Windows 10 computers. To fix the issue, try to install all the pending Windows updates that may include a hotfix. You can also add the printer manually to a local port or edit the registry entry to disable the problematic setting. If nothing works, uninstalling the security update may be the last resort.
