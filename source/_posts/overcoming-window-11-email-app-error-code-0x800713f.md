## Overcoming Window 11 Email App Error Code 0X800713F

 Mail is the default app for sending and receiving emails in Windows 11 and 10\. However, users can’t utilize that app when error 0x800713f arises with a message that says, “Something went wrong.” That error mostly occurs when users try to add email accounts to Mail. It can also occur when trying to send messages with the Mail app.

 Mail isn’t much good when users can’t add accounts and send emails with it. Does the 0x800713f error occur in your Mail app? If it does, you can resolve error 0x800713f with these potential resolutions.

## 1\. Use the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter

 The Windows Store Apps troubleshooter doesn’t fix every app error that occurs. However, that troubleshooting tool is always worth a try whenever a UWP app like Mail throws up an error code. You can give the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter a whirl as follows:

1. Instantly open Settings by pressing**Win + I** .
2. Select**System** \>**Troubleshoot** to access some navigation options.
3. Click the option labeled**Other trouble-shooters** .
4. Select**Run** beside the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.  
![The Windows Store Apps troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-troubleshooter-list.jpg)
5. Go through the troubleshooter and apply all suggestions it makes.  
![The Windows Store Apps troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/windows-store-apps-troubleshooter2.jpg)

 The same troubleshooter is available in Windows 10, but the steps for accessing it in Settings are a little different. You’ll need to select the**Update & Security** category in Windows 10’s Settings app. Then select the**Troubleshoot** tab and**Additional troubleshooters** to view the list of troubleshooting tools.

## 2\. Change the Privacy Settings for the Mail App

 The 0x800713f error can occur when the Mail and Calendar app isn’t allowed to access your email. So, you may need to enable email access for Mail via Settings, which is one of the most widely confirmed ways to fix the 0x800713f error. This is how you can change that privacy setting:

1. Go into the Settings app.
2. Select**Privacy & security** to view app permission navigation options.
3. Click the**Email** navigation option.  
![The Email navigation option in Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/email-navigation-option.jpg)
4. Turn on**Email access** if that option isn’t enabled.
5. Click**Let apps access your email** to expand options.  
![The Let apps access your email option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/let-apps-access-your-email.jpg)
6. Toggle the**Mail and Calendar** app on if it’s not already.
7. Also, turn on the**People** app listed there.

 If you find those settings are already turned on, try re-enabling them. Turn off the**Allows apps to access your email** and**Mail and Calendar** options, and click**Restart** on the Start menu. Then return to Settings to turn those settings back on after the restart.

## 3\. Reset and Repair the Mail App

 Windows 11 includes**Reset** and**Repair** options that can often fix buggy UWP apps showing error codes. Resetting the Mail app can eradicate corrupted data. Our guide to [resetting apps in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-reset-app/) provides further details on how to do that. You can also select an alternative**Repair** option for Mail just above its**Reset** button.

![The Reset button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-reset-option.jpg)

## 4\. Allow Mail and Calendar Through Windows Defender Firewall

 The Windows firewall filters inbound and outbound internet data. That firewall could be causing error 0x800713f by blocking the Mail and Calendar app. First, try temporarily disabling Windows Defender Firewall before opening Mail like this:

1. Open Windows Defender Firewall in your Control Panel. If you’re not sure how to access that applet, have a look at our guide for [opening the Windows firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-firewall-control-panel/) .
2. Click the**Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off** option situated along the left side of the WDF applet.  
![The Windows Defender Firewall applet](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-windows-defender-firewall-option.jpg)
3. Select the two**Turn off Windows Defender Firewall** settings available for public and private networks.  
![The Turn off Windows Defender Firewall option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/turn-off-windows-defender-firewall-options.jpg)
4. Next, press the**OK** button below the firewall settings.
5. Then bring up Mail and try adding an email account to it.

 If disabling the firewall resolves error 0x800713f, WDF was probably blocking Mail when it was on. We don’t recommend leaving the firewall off. Allow Mail through WDF as outlined within our guide for [allowing apps through the Windows firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/) . Then turn the firewall back on.

![Windows Defender Firewall's allowed apps](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/allowed-firewall-app.jpg)

 Do you have a third-party firewall on your desktop or laptop? If you do, that software could also be causing Mail app issues. Try disabling third-party firewall software to see if that makes a difference. If it does, check the firewall’s permission settings to ensure Mail is allowed through.

## 5\. Log in to Windows With a Local User Account

 Do you log in to Windows 11 with a Microsoft account? If yes, try logging in with a local user account and utilizing Mail from there. To do that, you’ll need to switch to a local one by changing your account settings like this:

1. Launch Settings with that app’s hotkey or from your Start menu.
2. Click on the**Accounts** tab (or category).
3. Next, select**Your Info** inside the**Accounts** tab.
4. Select the**Sign in** **with a local account** **instead** option.  
![The Sign in with a local account instead](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sign-in-with-a-local-user-account.jpg)
5. Click**Next** on the window that asks for confirmation about switching to a local account.

1. Type in your Microsoft account password or PIN.
2. Then fill out the local account boxes, and select the**Next** option.  
![Local account info boxes](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/enter-your-local-account-info.jpg)
3. Press the**Sign out** **and** **Finish** button.  
![The Sign out and finish button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-sign-out-and-finish-button.jpg)
4. Log in to your local user account.
5. Open**Mail** to check if the 0x800713f error has been fixed.

## 6\. Reinstall Mail and Calendar

 If nothing else resolves error 0x800713f, maybe you need to reinstall Mail and Calendar. Doing that will give you a fresh and up-to-date Mail app. You can uninstall and reinstall that app like this:

1. Use one of the many [ways to open the Apps & Features window](https://www.makeuseof.com/9-ways-to-open-the-apps-features-tool-in-windows-11/) .
2. Click**Mail and Calendar’s menu button** (with the three dots) in Apps & Features.
3. Select Mail and Calendar’s**Uninstall** option from there.  
![The Uninstall option for Mail and Calendar](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-uninstall-option2.jpg)
4. Click**Uninstall** a second time to remove the app.
5. Next, open the Mail and Calendar store page in whatever alternative browser you utilize.
6. Press the**Get in Store** app button on the Mail and Calendar page.  
![The Get in Store app button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/the-get-in-store-app-button.jpg)
7. Click Open in Microsoft Store to bring up a**Get** option for the app.
8. Select**Get** to reinstall Mail.

 The steps for reinstalling Mail in Windows 10 Settings are similar. You’ll need to select the**Apps** category in Settings. Then select Mail and Calendar in Apps & features, and press its**Uninstall** button.

## Send More Emails With the Mail App

 Those are six fixes that will probably resolve Mail’s 0x800713f error in most cases. They’re relatively quick and straightforward potential solutions to apply. With the 0x800713f error sorted, you’ll be able to add your email account and send messages in Mail again.
