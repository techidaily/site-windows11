 Most antivirus programs come with a security feature that stops installing malicious applications onto the computer.

 After disabling the security program, give a quick restart to your computer and check if the problem continues.

## 6\. Fix Any Corrupted Files on Your Computer

 Another reason behind this issue is corruption within the system files. Fortunately, you can detect and fix these files by running an SFC scan. However, before we run the SFC scan, it is best to do a preliminary scan to ensure that the SFC tool is working properly.

 The Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool (DISM) is an integrated Windows utility that offers a wide range of functionalities. In this case, the DISM Restorehealth command makes sure that our next fix will work properly. Work through the below steps:

1. Open the Start menu, type**Command** **Prompt** in the search bar, and select the**Run** **as administrator** option. It'll open Command Prompt with admin rights.
2. In the elevated Command Prompt window, type**DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth** and press**Enter** .
3. Wait until the command is executed. Depending on your computer's health, the process can take up to 15 minutes. Sometimes the process will stick, but wait for it to complete.
4. After the process is complete, type**sfc /scannow** and press**Enter** .

## 7\. Reset Your Computer
