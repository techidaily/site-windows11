## Reimagine Windows Interface: A Journey to Larger Icons

 Taskbar icons on Windows 11 are rendered at 24x24 but are natively at 32x32\. This means that the icons are downscaled, and can result in blurry icons or other unpleasant visuals.

 Let's have a look at how to resize these icons back to their native 32x32 size on Windows.

## Why You Should Resize the Taskbar Icons

 At sufficiently high enough resolutions, these downscaled icons can appear blurry or aliased. While you can mitigate this issue by [setting custom taskbar icons on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/change-taskbar-icons-programs-windows-10/), you're still restricted to the predefined icon size requirements Windows 11 has.

 As such, a 32x32 icon will always be resized down to 24x24 to appear on the taskbar. By permanently resizing these icons, you can do away with the blurriness while retaining the native Windows 11 icons.

## How to Resize Windows 11 Taskbar Icons Using Windhawk

 The easiest way to resize the Windows 11 Taskbar Icons is by using a program called Windhawk.

 Windhawk allows for a number of different quality-of-life Windows 11 modifications. To start, head over to [the Windhawk website](https://windhawk.net) to download and install the program.

 Once it is installed, run the program and seek out the **Explore** button.

 From here, search for the mod titled **Taskbar height and icon size.** Click on this and hit the **Install** button.

 The installation will take a moment. Once it's finalized, you should see the Windhawk modification on the home screen of the app. You may not see the changes to your taskbar immediately. If so, go ahead and either [restart Windows File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-restart-file-explorer-windows-10/) or the whole operating system.
