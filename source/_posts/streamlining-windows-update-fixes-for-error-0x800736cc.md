## Streamlining Windows Update Fixes for Error 0X800736CC

 Windows Update keeps your computer safe and secure with the latest security patches. However, you might encounter errors while installing these updates, like 0x800736cc. This error code stops you from deploying critical security updates, leaving your computer vulnerable. In this guide, we’ll show you some troubleshooting steps to fix this error.

## 1\. Restart Your PC

 The first thing you need to do is [restart your computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/). Although it may seem too simplistic, you'd be surprised how often this resolves various issues. When your computer reboots, it clears temporary files and processes that could cause problems. This includes incomplete Windows updates that failed to install or encountered installation errors.

 A quick reboot can bypass the error and complete the update, so it should be your primary course of action before delving into more intricate troubleshooting methods.

## 2\. Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter

 If restarting the PC doesn't work, you can use the Windows Update Troubleshooter. This built-in utility solves minor problems that prevent Windows from updating correctly.

 To run the Windows Update Troubleshooter, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + S** to open the Windows Search bar.
2. Type in **Troubleshoot** and select **Troubleshoot Settings** from the results list.
3. On the right sidebar, click **Other troubleshooters**.

4. Under **Most frequent**, locate **Windows Update** and click **Run**.  
![Run Windows Update Troubleshooter-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/run-windows-update-troubleshooter-1.jpg)

 Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process. It may take a few minutes for the tool to finish its job.

## 3\. Clear the Windows Update Cache

 Windows Update Cache stores temporary files and processes related to updates. If these files become corrupted, they can interfere with the update process and cause errors like 0x800736cc. In this case, clearing the cache can fix the problem.

 To clear the Windows Update Cache, do the following:

1. Open the Start menu.
2. Type **services.msc** in the search box and hit Enter. The Services window will open.
3. Scroll down and locate the **Windows Update** service. Then, right-click on it and select **Stop**. Doing so temporarily stops Windows Update.
4. Now, [open File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and navigate to this location:  
`C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution`
5. In the SoftwareDistribution folder, delete all files and folders. This is just temporary data, so removing it won't affect your computer.

6. After deleting the files, head back to the Services window, right-click on the **Windows Update** service, and select **Start**. This step restarts the Windows Update service.

 Now restart your computer. It will allow Windows Update to recreate cache files from scratch.

## 4\. Disable your Antivirus Temporarily

 Security software interferes with Windows Update and causes errors. To avoid this issue, [temporarily disable your security program](http://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-off-windows-defender/) before running updates. Once you have disabled it, restart the computer and install the update again. If it works, it was your security software that caused the issue.

 Remember that disabling security software leaves your computer vulnerable to malware attacks, so enable it immediately.

## 5\. Reset Windows Update Components

 Windows Update components include files and processes crucial to the update process. If these components become corrupted or damaged, Windows Update cannot run correctly. In this case, you must reset the components to their original state.

 Fortunately, there’s an easy way to do this. Microsoft provides a batch script called Reset Windows Update Tool that resets various Windows Update components with just a few clicks.

 To reset Windows Update components, follow these steps:

1. Click on Start and type **Notepad** in the search bar.
