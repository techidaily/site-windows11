## How to Use Separate Wallpapers on Different Monitors in Windows 11

 Windows 11 offers a handful of pre-installed wallpapers to set as your desktop background. If you prefer a custom background, you can use a saved picture or [download high-resolution wallpapers from the internet](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-sites-to-download-very-high-resolution-wallpapers/) and set different wallpaper for each monitor.

 To customize which wallpapers appear on which monitor:

1. Press **Win + I** to open **Settings**.
2. Open the **Personalization** tab, then click **Background** in the right pane.
3. Make sure the **Personalize your background** dropdown is set to **Picture**.

4. Click **Browse photos** and choose the image you want to set as a desktop background. Repeat the steps to add more photos.
5. Now right-click the image you want to set as a background for your primary monitor and choose **Set for** **desktop > Desktop 1**. Similarly, right-click on another wallpaper and select **Set for desktop > Desktop 2**. Repeat the steps for all your monitors.

 Alternatively, you can configure and [set a wallpaper slideshow in Windows 11 to automatically set different wallpapers](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-slideshows-no-installs/) on different monitors. To do this, select the **Personalize your background** dropdown and choose **Slideshow**. Then, click **Browse** and select the image album folder where your desktop background images are saved.

 Once done, Windows will regularly cycle through the pictures from the folder as a slideshow, at the **Change picture every** interval you choose.

## How to Set a Different Desktop Background for Each Monitor in Windows 10

 Like Windows 11, you can set different desktop backgrounds for different monitors in Windows 10:

1. Press **Win + I** to open **Settings**.
2. Open **Personalization**, then click the **Background** tab.
3. Click the **Background** drop-down and choose **Picture**.
4. Click **Browse** and choose the picture you want to set as your desktop background.
5. Right-click on the picture you want to apply to your primary display and select **Set for monitor 1**. Similarly, right-click on another image and choose **Set for monitor 2**. Repeat the steps if you have more than two monitors
