## How to Restore Windows Photo Viewer in Windows 10/11 Using the Registry

 You can enable the classic Windows Photo Viewer app using a Windows Registry script. The following Windows Registry script reconfigures and enables the Windows Photo Viewer app.

 Modifying your Windows Registry involves risk as incorrect modifications can cause your system to malfunction. If you intend to proceed with the steps below, first [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) and [back up your Windows Registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/). This will help you to recover your system if something goes wrong.

3. Press **Ctrl + Shift + S** to open the **Save** dialog. Alternatively, go to **File > Save As**.
4. In the **Save as** dialog, enter **ActivateWindowsPhotoViewer.reg** as the file name. Click the **Save as** **type** drop-down and choose **All Files(\*.\*)**. Choose a location and **Save** the file to your drive.

5. Next, open **File Explorer**, browse to the location where you saved the file, double-click **ActivateWindowsPhotoViewer.reg**, and then click **Yes**. When a warning prompt appears, click **Yes**.
6. After the script is executed, you'll see a success message. Click **OK**.
7. To apply the changes, press **Win + X** to open the **Windows Power** **menu** and choose **Task Manager**.
8. In the **Process** tab, find and right-click on **Windows Explorer**, then click **Restart**. Your screen may flash momentarily as Windows Explorer restarts.

 Since Windows Photos Viewer doesn't have its own .EXE file, [but only a .DLL](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-are-dll-files-on-windows/), you can't open it from the search bar in Windows. Instead, to open pictures in Photo Viewer, right-click on any image in **File Explorer**, go to **Open With > Choose another app**, and then scroll down and select **Windows Photo Viewer**. Choose **Just once** to open the image. If you select **Always**, Windows will set Photo Viewer as the default app for that image format.

 One Photo Viewer is an excellent Windows Photo Viewer and [Windows Photos alternative](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-windows-10-photos-app-alternatives/). It's fast, free, and offers a clean interface by placing all the controls in the context menu, decluttering the toolbar area. Right-click the app interface to view the menu and access all the tools and settings.

 One Photo Viewer offers all the bells and whistles you expect of an image viewer, plus more. You can scroll through the images using the arrow keys or the dedicated buttons, zoom in and out, rotate, crop, resize, or adjust colors.

 It also supports RAW formats, including HEIC and WEBP animation, a slideshow from a folder or loaded images, custom keyboard shortcuts, and a color correction tool to make quick enhancements. You can also opt for the $3 Pro version to get two additional features: a toolbar for improved functionality and thumbnails for easier navigation.

**Download:** [One Photo Viewer](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PM6W4F0XW3H) (Free, premium version available)

 That said, if you prefer to stick with a native option, give the built-in Windows Photos app another shot. It's not as bad as you may think upon first use.
