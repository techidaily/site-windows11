## 6\. Update Your GPU‚Äôs Driver

 The 0x887A0006 error message explicitly says that an issue has occurred with your PC‚Äôs display (graphics) adapter. That could mean there‚Äôs an outdated graphics driver on your PC that isn‚Äôt compatible with affected games. The probable solution in such a scenario is to update the driver for your PC‚Äôs GPU.

 You can update an NVIDIA or AMD driver in a few different ways. Some users utilize driver updater software packages, but some of them don't update graphics drivers to the newest ones available. To ensure you‚Äôre installing the very latest driver available for your GPU, download it from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.

 Our guide for [updating your graphics drivers on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) provides further details about the various methods.

2. Click the circle button that includes your user initials.
3. Select the **Settings** option on the menu that opens.

6. Add **d3d11** in the text box.

## 8\. Switch to the High-Performance Power Plan

 Error 0x887A0006 will more likely arise with the Power saver or Balanced power setting selected. Those power settings reduce PC performance for the sake of saving energy. So, try selecting the high-performance setting to ensure optimal gaming performance as follows:

1. To access the tool for finding files, apps, and folders, press the **Windows** logo + **S** keys simultaneously.
2. Type **powercfg.cpl** in the text box and click the matching search result.

6. Click **Create** to add the plan.
7. Select the new high-performance plan in the Power Options Control Panel applet.

## 9\. Don‚Äôt Overclock Your PC

 Overclocking GPUs or CPUs (central processors) is one of the more common causes of error 0x887A0006\. Have you overclocked your PC with overclocking software like CPU Tweaker, AMD Ryzan Master, or MSI Afterburner in any way? If so, it‚Äôs recommended you disable (undo) any overclocking you‚Äôve applied by restoring default system values with whatever overclock software you utilize.

 You can disable NVIDIA GPU overclocking with the method outlined for resolution two. However, that option won‚Äôt be available on PCs with AMD graphics cards. Nor will it be of any use for users who‚Äôve overclocked CPUs.
