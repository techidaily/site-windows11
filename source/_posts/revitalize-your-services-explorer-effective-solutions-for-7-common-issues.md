## Revitalize Your Services Explorer: Effective Solutions for 7 Common Issues

 Your Windows device uses various services to ensure that the system runs smoothly. For example, there’s a service that checks for software updates and another that allows you to share files. Fortunately, if your Windows services run into issues, you can repair them using the Services tool.

 However, there are instances when the Services tool might suddenly become unresponsive. In this article, we’ll cover some ways to fix the Services tool when it won’t open or respond.

## 1\. Quick Fixes for an Unresponsive Windows Services Tool

![A lady using her Windows PC while sitting on bed](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/A-lady-using-her-Windows-PC-while-sitting-on-bed.jpg)

 In most cases, you can fix an unresponsive Services app by restarting your device.

 Alternatively, try tackling the issue by running the Services app with administrator privileges. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Type**Services** in the Start menu search bar.
2. Right-click on the**Best match** result and select**Run as administrator** .

## 2\. Sign Into Your Device Using a Different Microsoft Account

 In some cases, the issue at hand might be specific to the account you’re using. If you have multiple accounts on your device, sign into a different account and see if that helps.

Here’s how you can sign in to a Microsoft account on Windows:

1. Press**Win + I** to open the settings window.
2. Select**Accounts** from the menu items.
3. Select**Email & accounts** on the left-hand side pane.
4. Click the**Add a Microsoft account** option on the right and then follow the on-screen instructions.

![Signing in With a Microsoft Account](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-Signing-in-With-a-Microsoft-Account.jpg)

Once you've signed in, check if the Services tool is accessible.

 If the problem is resolved, then it’s clear that your other account has issues. In this case, you could [fix this Windows issue by creating a new user account](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-issues-creating-new-user-account/) .

## 3\. Access the Services Tool in Safe Mode

 Do you suspect that the issue at hand might be caused by faulty programs? If so, you should consider running the Services tool in Safe Mode. That way, all your third-party apps (including the faulty ones) will be disabled when the device boots up.

Here are the steps for running the Services tool in safe mode:

1. Type**Settings** in the Start Menu search bar and select the**Best match** .
2. Select**Update & Security** and then click the**Recovery** option.
3. Click the**Restart Now** button below the Advanced Startup option. This will restart your PC in the Recovery Environment.

![Installing Programs in Safe Mode](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-Installing-Programs-in-Safe-Mode.jpg)

 Next, click**Advanced options** and select**Startup Settings** . From there, press the**Restart** button and then press the**F4** key to boot your PC into Safe Mode.

 Now, try opening the Services tool. If you no longer run into problems, then it’s safe to say that a faulty software program is causing the issue at hand. Now you'll need to find the problematic app and update or remove it.

## 4\. Run Windows' Built-In Troubleshooters

 Windows' built-in troubleshooters could fix the problem you're experiencing without needing to go through Services. These tools can fix almost any system issue—from network-related errors to hardware problems.

 To tackle system maintenance issues, you can use the System Maintenance troubleshooter. And for hardware-related problems, you can use the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter.

 If you’re dealing with a system maintenance issue, here’s how you can tackle it using the System Maintenance troubleshooter:

1. Type**Perform recommended maintenance tasks automatically** in the Start menu search bar and select the**Best match** .
2. Press the**Next** button in the bottom-right corner and then follow the on-screen instructions.

![Running the System Maintenance Troubleshooter on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Running-the-System-Maintenance-Troubleshooter-on-Windows.jpg)

 But if you’re dealing with a hardware-related problem, here’s how you can resolve it using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter:

1. Type**Troubleshoot** in the Start menu search bar and select the**Best match** .
2. Click the**Additional troubleshooters** option on the right-hand side.
3. Click the**Hardware and Devices troubleshooter** and press the**Run the troubleshooter** button.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions and then restart your PC to save these changes.

## 5\. Run a System Scan

 In some cases, the issue at hand might stem from malware. As such, try scanning your device and remove any malware that's found.

Here are the steps for running a system scan:

1. Type**Windows Security** in the Start menu search bar and select the**Best match** .
2. Select**Virus & threat protection** on the next window.
3. Select**Scan options** and pick any relevant option from the list.
4. Press the**Scan now** button and follow the on-screen instructions to finalize the process.

## 6\. Use the DISM and SFC Tools

 If you’re dealing with stubborn malware or corruption, then a simple system scan might not be enough. In such instances, you’d need to use reliable features such as the DISM and SFC tools.

Here's how to run the DISM tool:

1. Type**Command Prompt** in the Start menu search bar.
2. Right-click on the**Best match** result and select**Run as administrator** .
3. Type the following command and press**Enter** :  
`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth`
4. When this scan is complete, type the following command and then press**Enter** :  
`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`

Restart your PC once the scan is complete.

Now, you can now run the SFC tool through these steps:

1. Open the**Command Prompt** by following the previous steps.
2. Type the following command and then press**Enter** :  
`sfc /scannow`

 Wait for this process to complete and then close the Command Prompt. Finally, restart your computer to save these changes.

## 7\. Reset Windows

![A lady using a Windows PC while holding a cup](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/A-lady-using-a-Windows-PC-while-holding-a-cup.jpg)

 By now, the Services tool should be up and running. But if the issue persists, then you might consider resetting your device.

 When you reset Windows, the system will be restored to its factory settings, but your data will be safe. But to be on the safe side, consider [backing up your Windows device to the cloud](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-windows-computer-cloud/) first before resetting it.

Now, here are the steps for resetting Windows:

1. Press**Win + I** to open the system settings.
2. Select**Update & Security** .
3. Select**Recovery** on the left-hand side.
4. Click the**Get started** button below the Reset this PC option.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions and then wait for the process to complete.

## The Services App Is Now Up and Running

 The Windows services ensure that your PC operates smoothly at all times. Meanwhile, the Services tool can help you troubleshoot various system issues depending on the nature of the problem.

 However, the Services app often runs into issues and won’t respond. If this tool won't open, repair it using any of the methods we’ve covered. And once you’ve resolved the issue at hand, you could consider managing the Windows services from time to time.
