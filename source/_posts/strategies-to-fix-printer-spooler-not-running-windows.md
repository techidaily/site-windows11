## 5\. Check Windows Defender Firewall

 If your printer is connected to a network, it is possible that Windows Defender Firewall is preventing the connection resulting in the error.

 To disable Windows Defender Firewall:

1. Press **Win + I** to open **Settings**.
2. Open the **Privacy & security** tab in the left pane.
