## Eliminating 'Cannot View' Messages From Your Microsoft Office Mail

 Do you keep getting the "this file cannot be previewed" error when previewing attachments in Outlook? The good news is that you don't need to download attachments every time you want to view them, as it is possible to fix this annoying issue.

 Below, we share eight quick and easy fixes for resolving the “this file cannot be previewed” error in Outlook for Windows.

## 1\. Install Relevant Apps to Preview Files

 Outlook may fail to preview attachments if the appropriate app for the file format is not installed on your PC. For instance, if you don’t have a[PDF reader app on your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-pdf-readers-windows/) , Outlook may display the “this file cannot be previewed because there is no previewer installed for it” error.

 To avoid this, ensure that the appropriate app or software for the file format is available on your computer. After that, Outlook should be able to preview your files without any problems.

## 2\. Disable Preview Handler in PowerToys

 Using Microsoft PowerToys is an excellent way to[boost your productivity on Windows computers](https://www.makeuseof.com/set-up-windows-pc-maximum-productivity/) . However, these PowerToys utilities can sometimes interfere with app processes and prevent apps from working properly.

 Several users on the forums reported fixing Outlook’s “this file cannot be previewed” error by disabling the Preview Handler feature. You can also give this method a shot.

1. Open the**PowerToys** app using the search menu.
2. Switch to the**File Explorer add-ons** tab using the left sidebar.
3. Under the**Preview Pane** section, disable the toggle next to**Portable Document Format** .

## 3\. Enable Attachment Preview in Outlook

1. Open the**Outlook** app on your PC.
2. Click the**File** menu in the top left corner.
3. Select**Options** from the left sidebar.
4. Navigate to the**Trust Center** tab and click the**Trust Center Settings** button.
5. In the**Attachment Handling** tab, clear the**Turn off Attachment Preview** checkbox.

## 5\. Clear Outlook Cache

 Outlook, like most apps, stores cache files on your computer to reduce loading times. Although this data is supposed to improve app performance, it’s not uncommon for it to become corrupted over time. When this happens, Outlook may malfunction or throw strange errors. You can try deleting the Outlook cache and see if that helps.

To delete Outlook cache data on Windows, use these steps:

1. Right-click on the Start icon or press**Win + X** to open the Power User menu.
2. Select**Run** from the list.
3. Type**%localappdata%\\Microsoft\\Outlook** in the text box and press**Enter** .
4. In the**RoamCache** folder that appears, select all the files and click the**trash icon** at the top to delete them.

 Here's how to check if the Windows Defender Firewall is enabled on your PC.

1. Press**Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type**Windows Security** in the search box and press**Enter** .
3. Select**Firewall & network protection** tab from the left pane.

## 7\. Modify Registry Files

 Incorrect[Windows Registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-the-windows-registry-editor-and-how-do-i-use-it-makeuseof-explains/) settings could also cause such anomalies. If that's the case, you'll need to correct the Registry settings manually on your PC.

 Since Registry files contain important settings for Windows and its apps, you should only use this method if you’re familiar with editing Registry files. Also, it’s a good idea to back up all the Registry files before you proceed. If you need help with that, check our guide on[how to back up Windows Registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) and follow the steps outlined there.

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
2. Type**regedit** in the text box and press**Enter** .
3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. Use the left pane to navigate to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE > ​SOFTWARE > ​Microsoft > ​Windows > ​CurrentVersion > ​PreviewHandlers** .
5. Look for the following string values and check the associated**Data** on the right side.  
`{00020827-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} = Microsoft Excel previewer  
{21E17C2F-AD3A-4b89-841F-09CFE02D16B7} = Microsoft Visio previewer  
{65235197-874B-4A07-BDC5-E65EA825B718} = Microsoft PowerPoint previewer

## 8\. Run the Microsoft Office Repair Tool
