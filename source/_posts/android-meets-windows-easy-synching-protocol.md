## Android Meets Windows: Easy Synching Protocol

 When you sync your Android with Windows, you get a host of decentralizing benefits, such as the ability to share your data or control across multiple devices or nodes, protection from single points of failure, etc.

 In practical terms, you can make phone calls, read and send text messages, get notifications, and more—straight from your PC. So let’s look at all the different ways to connect your Android to a Windows PC.

## How to Sync Your Android With Windows

 Interestingly, there's a vast diversity of ways to record your files on Windows. In fact, there are more than a few ways to do this: Phone Link app, Unison app, and even third-party apps like AirDroid are a few examples.

 Let’s look over them all one by one.

### 1\. Phone Link

 Just like the Phone Link, Intel Unison is specifically designed to help you connect your Android or iOS devices to a Windows PC. Install the app, and you can then move your files and images between devices, receive notifications, and respond to text messages with ease.

 Both Phone Link and Intel Unison are pretty much similar in their functionalities; the only noticeable difference is perhaps their integrations—while Phone Link has more features and integration for Microsoft products, Intel Unison is geared more towards Intel users.
