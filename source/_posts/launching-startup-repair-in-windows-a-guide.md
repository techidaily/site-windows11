## Launching Startup Repair in Windows: A Guide

 Startup Repair is a free tool from Microsoft that scans for and then fixes many common Windows problems, including the ones encountered during a startup. But launching and using the tool can get tricky depending on the error you are facing.

 We have looked over a host of different ways to access the tool. So, let’s look at all of them one by one.

2. Now, select the **System > Recovery** button.
3. From under the **Advanced Startup** section, click on **Restart now**.
