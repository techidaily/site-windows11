## Effective Strategies for Cleansing Steam DNS Cache

 Steam uses an inbuilt Chrome-based web browser to access features like the store or the friend list. Like any other browser, this can be prone to fail and cause errors. And, like any other browser, sometimes flushing its DNS cache can fix any issues.

 Let's explore how to flush the Steam DNS cache to fix host connection errors on Windows.

## Why Should You Flush the Steam DNS Cache?

 A DNS cache is essentially a small databank of IP addresses that your computer has connected to. Many different programs have a DNS cache, and because Steam can access the internet, it has its own cache.

 If an IP address becomes outdated, or there's a change on either end of the server, you may run into issues that require your cache to be flushed. For example, if you're receiving host connection errors within Steam.

![screenshot of the steam console](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/screenshot_of_steam_console.jpg)

To enable the Steam console, follow these steps:

1. Hit**Win + R** to bring up the**Run** .
2. Type in the following string of text and hit**Enter** :  
`steam://open/console`

 Steam should automatically open and show you the console screen. You'll know you did it correctly if you see a largely-empty window with a system startup time at the top and a text entry box at the bottom.

 If you don't see it, check next to your username at the top-left of Steam. There should be an additional tab named "console" to the right.

 Despite being a simple fix for a wide range of issues, not many people realize Steam has a console. And while it'd be nice if Valve made the console more evident for its users, it's still easy enough to open and can flush the DNS in a handful of clicks.
