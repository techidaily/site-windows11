## Disabling Taskbar Time in Windows 11

 The system tray clock on the right side of the Windows taskbar shows the date and time. While most users find this information useful, others might consider it a source of distraction.

 As such, if you want to hide the clock and date from the taskbar, then this is the place where you need to be. We'll share three different ways by which you can configure the taskbar to hide or show the clock and date.

## 1\. Hide or Show the Clock and Date from the Taskbar by Using Windows System Settings

 The System Settings is the central hub of a Windows PC. You can use it to update Windows, manage privacy settings,[customize the taskbar](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-customize-taskbar/) , and more.

 It's also one of the places from where you can configure the taskbar to hide or show the clock and date. You can do this by following the below instructions:

 This method only works for Windows 10\. If you are using Windows 11, you can try any other method in this article.

2. Choose the**Personalization** option.
3. Select**Taskbar** from the left panel.
