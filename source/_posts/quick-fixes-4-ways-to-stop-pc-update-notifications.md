## Quick Fixes: 4 Ways to Stop PC Update Notifications

 By default, all your Office apps are set to update themselves automatically in the background. Although this approach keeps your Office apps updated with the latest features and improvements, these updates can sometimes overwhelm you or worse, cause new problems.

 Fortunately, there are several ways to disable automatic Office updates on Windows. Let's go over each of those methods one by one.

## 1\. How to Stop Automatic Office Updates via the Settings App

 Windows lets you check for any pending Office updates directly from the Settings app. This allows you to install Office updates along with other system updates. If you don’t want that, you can disable the**Receive updates for other Microsoft products** option in the Settings app. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Open the**Start menu** and click the**gear icon** to launch the Settings app.
2. Select**Windows Update** from the left sidebar.
3. Select**Advanced options** .
4. Disable the toggle next to**Receive updates for other Microsoft products** .

## 2\. How to Stop Automatic Office Updates Using One of Its Apps

 You can also opt out of automatic Office updates by using one of its apps, such as Word or Excel. Here’s how you can go about it.

1. Open any Office app, such as Word.
2. Click the**File** menu in the top left corner.
3. Select**Account** from the left pane.
4. Click the**Update Options** drop-down menu in the Manage Account section and choose**Disable Updates** .
5. Select**Yes** to confirm.

 Once you complete the above steps, your Office apps will not check for and install newer updates. Don't worry, you'll still be able to install updates manually.

 If you want to re-enable automatic updates later, use the same steps above and select**Enable Update** in the**Update Options** menu.

## 3\. How to Stop Automatic Office Updates Using the Group Policy Editor

 Another way to disable automatic Office updates is via the Group Policy Editor. It’s worth noting that you can only access the Group Policy Editor on Professional, Education, or Enterprise editions of Windows. If you're on Windows Home, be sure to check out[how to access the Local Group Policy Editor on Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/) before continuing.

 By default, the Group Policy Editor does not include any modules for managing Microsoft Office settings. So, in order to stop automatic Office updates via the Group Policy Editor, first, you’ll have to download and install Administrative Templates for Microsoft Office products. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Open up your web browser and head over to Microsoft Download Center to[download the Administrative Template files (ADMX/ADML) for Office apps](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49030) .

2. Double-click the downloaded**EXE file** to run it.
3. Accept the license terms and click the**Continue** button.
4. The installer will prompt you for a location to extract the contents. Select an empty folder and hit**OK** .
5. Go to the location where you extracted the files and open the**admx** folder.
6. Select all the**admx files** and press**Ctrl + C** to copy them.
7. Head to**C: > Windows > PolicyDefinitions** folder.
8. Paste all the admx files in the**PolicyDefinitions** folder.

## 4\. How to Stop Automatic Office Updates With the Registry Editor

 You can also use the Registry Editor to make the above policy change and disable automatic Office updates on your computer. Since Registry Editor holds important settings for Windows and its apps, you should only use this method if you’re comfortable editing the[Windows Registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-the-windows-registry-editor-and-how-do-i-use-it-makeuseof-explains/) .

 If you decide to use this method, make sure you back up all the registry files or create a restore point beforehand. If you need help, refer to our guide on[how to create a restore point on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) and follow the steps outlined there.

 Once you've done that, use the following steps to disable automatic Office updates via the Registry Editor.

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
2. Type**regedit** in the text box and press**Enter** to open the Registry Editor.
3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. Use the left pane to navigate to **Computer > HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE > SOFTWARE > Policies > Microsoft** .  
![Registry Editor window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/registry-editor.jpg)
5. Right-click the**Microsoft** key and select**New > Key** .

5. Rename the key as**Common** .
6. Within the**Common** key, create another key named**OfficeUpdate** .
7. Right-click the**OfficeUpdate** key and select**New > DWORD (32-bit) Value** . Name this new DWORD**EnableAutomaticUpdates** .
8. Double-click**EnableAutomaticUpdates** DWORD and set its**Value Data** to**0** .
9. Click**OK** .  
![Turn Off Automatic Office Updates Using Registry Editor](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/turn-off-automatic-office-updates-using-registry-editor.jpg)
