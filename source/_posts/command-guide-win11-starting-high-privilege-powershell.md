## Command Guide: Win11 - Starting High-Privilege PowerShell

 PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language built on .NET technology.

If you want to use PowerShell to do anything more than basic tasks, you must run it as an administrator.

 In this guide, we'll show you ten simple ways to open an elevated PowerShell prompt on Windows 11.
