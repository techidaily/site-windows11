## Revamping Network Defenses with These 5 Steps

 The Windows Firewall protects your device from malicious threats. But if you don't configure its settings correctly, this tool might prevent you from accessing most of the apps on your device.

 So, what's the solution if you've configured the wrong firewall settings by mistake? It's simple—all you need to do is reset these settings to their defaults.

 Let’s dive in and explore all the solutions.

## 1\. Use the Control Panel

 The Control Panel is an incredible tool that allows you to troubleshoot system issues or tweak PC settings. Now, let’s check out how this tool can help you reset the firewall settings:

1. Type **Control Panel** in the Start menu search bar and select the **Best match**. Alternatively, check out [the various way to access the Control Panel](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-control-panel/).
2. Click the **View by** drop-down menu and select either the **Small icons** or **Large icons** option.
3. Select **Windows Defender Firewall** from the menu items.
