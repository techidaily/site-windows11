 Windows Sound Settings lets you customize and optimize audio. This includes adjusting volume, changing playback devices, and fine-tuning equalizer settings. But how can you access these settings quickly on your computer?

 This guide shows you nine different methods to find and open Sound Settings in Windows 11\.
