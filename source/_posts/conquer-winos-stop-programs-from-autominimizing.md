## Conquer WinOS: Stop Programs From AutoMinimizing

 One day, you're using your Windows device and realize that some apps minimize themselves without warning. But why are you encountering this issue? Well, there are several potential causes—ranging from misconfigured settings to malware infections.

 Fortunately, we’ve got all the solutions that’ll help you resolve this problem. So, let’s explore why you’re encountering this issue and how you can tackle it.

## Why Do Your Programs Automatically Minimize Themselves?

 Here are some common reasons why your programs may be automatically minimizing themselves:

* **Focus Stealing**: Certain apps or background processes may steal the focus from an active program and cause it to minimize. This can happen due to notifications, pop-up messages, or other system events that require attention.
* **Misconfigured Multitasking Settings**: Windows has built-in multitasking features such as the "Snap windows" tool. Such features allow you to automatically arrange a window when you drag it to the edge of the screen. But if these tools are misconfigured, they can cause programs to minimize unexpectedly.
* **Faulty Display Drivers**: Outdated or corrupted display drivers can cause conflicts with apps and make your apps minimize themselves unexpectedly.
* **Compatibility Issues**: Some programs may not be fully compatible with your Windows version. So, such apps might often minimize themselves as a response to compatibility issues.
* **Third-Party Software Interference**: Sometimes, certain third-party apps (such as antivirus programs) can conflict with other programs and cause them to minimize without warning.
* **Malware or Viruses**: Malicious software can interfere with your programs and cause them to minimize themselves or behave unexpectedly.

 Now, it’s time to explore the solutions.

## 1\. Disable Unnecessary Background Processes

 If the issue is caused by focus stealing, then stopping some of your background processes could help. Here's how you can do it:

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open the Task Manager.
2. Navigate to the **Processes** tab.
3. Scroll down to the **Background processes** section.
4. Right-click on the processes that you deem unnecessary and select **End Task** to stop them.

![Stopping a background processes on the Task Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stopping-a-background-processes-on-the-task-manager.jpg)

 Close the Task Manager and restart your device to save these changes.

 Keep in mind that some background processes are essential for the proper functioning of your PC. So, exercise caution when terminating processes in the Task Manager. If you’re unsure about a particular process, research it first to ensure that it’s safe to stop.

## 2\. Configure the Windows Multitasking Settings

 There’s a high chance that your apps minimize themselves because of the way you’ve configured the multitasking settings. So, let’s check out the few tweaks you should make to tackle this problem:

1. Press **Win + I** to open the system settings.
2. Click the **System** option.
3. Select **Multitasking** from the options on the left.
4. Uncheck the **When I snap a window, automatically size it to fill available space** option. When this option is enabled, you can make an app fill the entire screen by dragging it to the edge. But this will automatically minimize other apps, which is something you probably don’t want to do.

![Configuring the Multitasking Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/configuring-the-multitasking-settings.jpg)

 If the issue persists, consider disabling the box in the bottom part of the "Snap windows" section. Alternatively, you could consider turning off the "Snap windows" feature.

## 3\. Update the Display Drivers or Run the Compatibility Troubleshooter

 By [updating the display drivers on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/), you provide a stable and compatible graphics environment for your PC. Not only will this reduce the chances of programs automatically minimizing, but it’ll also tackle other system issues.

 And if you suspect that the error is caused by compatibility issues, then the compatibility troubleshooter should help. The tool will attempt to detect and resolve any compatibility issues related to the program.

 Here are the steps to run the compatibility troubleshooter on Windows:

1. Press **Win + I** to open the system settings.
2. Click **Update & Security** from the options.
3. Select **Troubleshoot** on the left-hand side.
4. Click the **Additional troubleshooters** option on the right.
5. Select the **Program Compatibility Troubleshooter** option and click the **Run the troubleshooter** button.

![Running the Compatibility Troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/running-the-compatibility-troubleshooter.jpg)

 To further resolve compatibility issues, consider [updating your Windows device](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/).

## 4\. Resolve Software Conflicts

 We discovered earlier that security software (or faulty third-party apps) can interfere with the normal functioning of other programs. This means it's likely that such programs could cause other apps to minimize unexpectedly.

 Now, let’s explore how to resolve software conflicts that stem from security software or faulty third-party apps:

* **Identify Suspicious Software**: Take note of any recently installed software that's likely causing other apps to minimize unexpectedly.
* **Temporarily Disable or Reinstall Security Software**: Temporarily disable security software (such as antivirus programs) and see if that helps. And if you’re using a third-party security program, uninstall it temporarily and check if that resolves the issue. From there, reinstall the tool from a reputed website.
* **Update Conflicting Software**: If you suspect the issue is caused by outdated third-party apps, try updating those apps and see if that tackles the issue.

 So, what if the issue stems from malware? In that case, you’d need to clean up your PC with [the best malware removal tools](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-malware-removal-tools-pc/).

## 5\. Turn Off Game Mode

 Game Mode is a Windows feature designed to optimize system performance for gaming. However, it may sometimes interfere with some tools and cause them to minimize unexpectedly. This means disabling the "Game Mode" feature can be a potential solution to the issue at hand.

 So, let’s check out how you can turn this feature off:

1. Press **Win + I** to open the system settings.
2. Select **Gaming** from the options.
3. Click **Game Mode** on the left-hand side.
4. **Turn off** the “Game Mode” button on the right-hand side pane.

![Turning Off Game Mode on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/turning-off-game-mode-on-windows.jpg)

 Close the settings app and check if this resolves the issue.

 Turning off Game Mode may slightly affect gaming performance because the system will no longer focus on allocating resources specifically for gaming.

## 6\. Run the System Maintenance Troubleshooter

 Maybe the issue at hand is caused by system maintenance problems. And in that case, running the System Maintenance troubleshooter should help tackle the problem. So, let's take you through how you can use this tool:

1. Type **Perform recommended maintenance tasks automatically** in the Start menu search bar.
2. Select the **Best match** result to open the System Maintenance troubleshooter.
3. Click the **Advanced** option and then check the **Apply repairs automatically** box.
4. Click **Next** and follow the on-screen steps to finalize the process.

## 7\. Edit the Registry Editor

 As a last resort, you could consider tweaking some settings in the Registry Editor. But make sure you [back up the Registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) first before you proceed. That’s because you might wreak havoc on your PC if you mistakenly tweak the wrong Registry keys.

 To resolve the issue at hand, you'll have to tweak the ForegroundLockTimeout registry key. This is a setting that controls the timeout duration for foreground processes. Simply put, it determines the amount of time a process must remain in the foreground before the device considers it unresponsive.

 To ensure that everything runs smoothly, you'll have to set the value of the ForegroundLockTimeout registry key to its default.

 Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Type **Registry Editor** in the Start menu search bar and select the **Best match** result.
2. Copy-paste the following command into the address bar and press **Enter**:

Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop

 From there, double-click on the **ForegroundLockTimeout** value on the right-hand side pane.

![Clicking the ForegroundLockTimeout value in the Registry Editor](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/clicking-the-foregroundlocktimeout-value-in-the-registry-editor.jpg)

 Next, set its Value data to **249f0** and then click **OK**. This is the default value that should help get rid of the issue at hand. Finally, close the Registry Editor and restart your device to save these changes.
