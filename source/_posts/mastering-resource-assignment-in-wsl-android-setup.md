## Mastering Resource Assignment in WSL-Android Setup

 When running Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA) on your Windows 11 PC, you might not like how the virtual machine for Android apps uses resources. These resources include memory, CPU, and GPU. Luckily, you can manage that pretty easily, and we’re going to show you how.

## "As Needed" or "Continuous?" Which One to Choose

 You have two choices when it comes to the way WSA uses your computer’s resources:**As needed** or**Continuous** .

 When you select**As needed** , it means the Subsystem will boot up from scratch, which can make the [Android apps you’ve side-loaded on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-sideload-android-apps/) take longer to start up. This is the best option if your Windows 11 computer doesn’t have enough resources to spare. It is also the default option.

 If you find the process of installing Android apps with Windows Subsystem for Android a bit difficult, you can make it easier by reading our guide on [how to install Android apps with a double-click on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/install-android-apks-double-click-windows-11/) .

**Continuous** , on the other hand, keeps WSA running in the background. The benefit is that Android apps will fire up much quicker at the cost of using more of your computer’s resources. You can choose this option if your Windows 11 PC has the resources to spare.

## How Do I Manage the Way Windows Subsystem for Android Uses Its Resources?

 To change the way the Windows Subsystem for Android utilizes resources on Windows 11, start by pressing**Win + S** to bring up Windows Search. In the search box, type**windows subsystem for android** . In the results click on**Windows Subsystem for Android Settings** to launch the program.

 Now Windows Subsystem for Android will use resources depending on the option you have chosen.

## The Best Way For Windows Subsystem for Android to Use Resources

 Whether you pick**As needed** or**Continuous** depends on how many resources your Windows 11 computer has. To recap, choose**As needed** if you’re low on resources and pick**Continuous** if you have enough so WSA doesn’t negatively impact performance.
