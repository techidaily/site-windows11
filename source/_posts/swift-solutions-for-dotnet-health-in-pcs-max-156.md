 If the repair tool doesn’t work, you can use other workarounds to try and fix the framework errors. So, here are a few ways you can repair .NET Framework on your Windows computer.

## 3\. How to Repair .NET Framework Using PowerShell

 If the issue persists, try reinstalling .NET Framework on your Windows PC using [PowerShell](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-windows-powershell/) . You can use the shell application to perform a clean install of the .NET Framework and other associated tools. Here’s how to do it.

2. Right-click on**PowerShell** and select**Run as administrator.**
3. In the PowerShell window, type the following cmdlet and press**Enter** :  
`Get-Package -Name &ldquo;Microsoft .Net*&rdquo; | Uninstall-Package`
4. PowerShell may prompt you to install**NuGet** – a packet manager necessary to perform this action. So, type**Y** and press**Enter** .  
![uninstall dot net framework powershell](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/uninstall-dot-net-framework-powershell.jpg)

`winget install Microsoft.dotNetFramework`
7. PowerShell will download and extract the package. You will see a successfully installed message once the process is complete.
8. Restart your PC to apply the changes and check for any improvements.

## 4\. How to Manually Install an Older .NET Framework Version

 You can install only the latest version of .NET Framework using PowerShell. However, an app may sometimes require an older version of the .NET Framework to work. If reinstalling from the Optional Features dialog didn't help, you can manually install the framework from the .NET Framework download page.

To manually install older versions of the .NET Framework:

1. Go to the [.NET Framework download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework) .
2. Under the**Supported versions** section, click on the**.NET Framework** version you want to download.
3. On the next page, click on**Download .NET Framework XX Runtime.**
4. Once the download is complete, open the download location and run the**dotnetfx.exe** file to launch the setup. Click**Yes** , if prompted by UAC.
5. Next, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.
6. Restart your PC and then try to install the app to see if it works.

## 5\. Run the System File Checker Tool

![run system file check dism windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/run-system-file-check-dism-windows-11.jpeg)

 The System File Checker tool is a built-in system repair utility that finds and fixes missing or corrupted system files. You can use the tool to fix any system issues that may conflict with the .NET Framework.

To run the System File Checker tool:

1. Press the**Win key** and type**cmd** .
2. Right-click on**Command Prompt** from the search result and select**Run as administrator.**
3. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:  
`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`
4. The above DISM command is recommended to run before the System File Checker tool as it will provide files required to fix system file corruption.
5. Once the process is complete, run the following command and press Enter:  
`sfc /scannow`

 The SFC tool will now scan your system files for issues and replace any corrupted files as necessary. Wait for the verification process to complete.
