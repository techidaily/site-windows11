## Unheard Voices in Meet: Solving Windows Microphone Problems

 Is your microphone not working in Google Meet? Did you join a meeting, but nobody heard you? It seems like a technical problem, but don’t give up hope yet. This guide explains how to troubleshoot and fix the issue of not using your Google Meet microphone on Windows.

## Why Is Google Meet Not Working With Your Microphone?

 Google Meet facilitates remote collaboration and communication. If you're having trouble hearing others during a Google Meet, it could be due to microphone issues. Some of the possible causes are:​

1. A slow or unstable Internet connection often leads to microphone issues in Google Meet.
2. An outdated version of Google Meet causes this error, so make sure it’s up-to-date.
3. If your microphone is plugged in correctly and the settings are correct, but you still can’t hear your voice, it may be a hardware issue. You should check the physical connections and make sure all parts work correctly.
4. If there is background noise, Google Meet can't isolate your voice. This may result in poor audio quality and microphone issues.

 Now you understand the causes of the microphone issue, let’s look at how to troubleshoot and solve it.

 Before you begin troubleshooting, check if you're in [Companion Mode on Google Meet](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-companion-mode-on-google-meet/). If so, leave and rejoin the meeting as the microphone and speaker are unavailable in this mode. Once you’ve verified that, try these fixes.

## 1\. Unmute the Microphone

 If you’re unable to use your Google Meet microphone, check if it is muted. If so, other people can't hear you. To unmute it, click the Microphone icon in the lower-left corner of the Google Meet window.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If you don’t see this icon, press **Ctrl + D** on your keyboard. This will unmute the Microphone and allow others to hear you in the meeting.

## 2\. Test Google Meet Microphone

 If you unmute the microphone and still can't get it to work, try testing the microphone. This is how you do it.

1. Click the **three dots** (More options) in the lower-right corner of the Google Meet window.

2. Select **Settings** from the menu.
3. In the pop-up window, click **Audio** from the left sidebar.

4. Click the **Microphone** drop-down menu and go with the default.
5. Now speak out loud and check whether the meter next to the microphone icon moves.

 If it does, your microphone is working correctly, otherwise, select a different microphone and repeat the steps.

## 3\. Check the Microphone in System Settings

 If the microphone test doesn't work, it’s possible that your computer's settings prevent Google Meet from using the microphone. To verify this, do the following.

1. Press the **Win + I** on your keyboard to open Settings.
2. From the left pane, click **System** \> **Sound**.

3. Scroll down to the **Input** section and click on **Microphone Array**.

5. Next, in the **Input settings**, set the microphone volume to an optimal level.
6. Now click the **Start test** button and talk or play audio out loud for a few seconds.

7. Then click **Stop test** to end the test. You should see a percentage display telling you how loud your microphone is.

 Now that everything is set up right and the microphone test works, try starting a Google Meet call to test the sound.

## 5\. Troubleshoot Microphone Problems

2. Select **System** \> **Sound** from the Settings menu.
3. Now scroll down to the **Advanced** section.

6. Scroll down and make sure the apps you want to use have permission to access your microphone.

 Once all settings are correct, try starting a Google Meet call and see if the microphone works.

## 5\. Check Browser Permissions

 Using the wrong browser settings prevents Google Meet from accessing your microphone. It seems simple but is often overlooked.

 To check your browser permissions, follow these steps:

1. Open Google Chrome or any other browser you're using.
2. Click **three dots** in the top-right corner and select Settings.
3. Click **Privacy and security** in the left panel.

 Once you’ve checked the permissions are correct, try joining a Google Meet call using your microphone.

## 6\. Clear Browser Cache and Cookies

1. Open your browser and press the **Ctrl + Shift + Del** shortcut keys. This will open the Clear browsing data window.
2. Select **All time** from the **Time range** drop-down menu.
3. Make sure **Cookies and other site data** and **Cached images and files** are checked.  
![Clear browsing data](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/clear-browsing-data.jpg)
4. Click **Clear data** at the bottom of the window.

 Once you clear the browser data, restart the browser and join the Google Meet call again. Your microphone should work now.
