## Navigating PowerToys to Tailor Snap Layouts

 With the Snap Layouts feature in Windows, you can snap your windows into different positions and organize your computer screen to your liking. As useful as this feature is, it does not give you the option to edit pre-defined layouts or customize them in any way.

 Fortunately, you don’t have to settle for the default snap layout options. With PowerToys, you can create custom snap layouts for your Windows 10 or 11 computer and multitask with ease. Let’s see how.

## How to Create Custom Snap Layouts in PowerToys

 PowerToys' FancyZones feature lets you arrange your windows into custom layouts. Here's how you can use its layout editor to create and save custom snap layouts.

1. [Download and install PowerToys](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-powertoys/XP89DCGQ3K6VLD) from Microsoft Store.
2. Once installed, open the**PowerToys** app[using the search menu](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-search-use-guide/) .
3. Select the**FancyZones** tab from the left sidebar.
4. Turn on the toggle next to**Enable FancyZones** .

5. Click the**Launch layout editor** option.
6. Select the monitor for which you want to design layouts.
7. Click the**pencil icon** next to one of the layout templates to edit it.
8. In the following window, use the sliders to change the number of zones, spaces around zones, and highlight distance.
9. Click the**Save** button to save your changes.

 If the existing layout templates aren't enough for you, PowerToys also gives you the option to create new snap layouts from scratch. Here’s how to create one.

1. In the PowerToys app, navigate to the**FancyZones** tab.
2. Click the**Create new layout** button.
3. Enter a suitable name for your custom layout and select your preferred layout type.
4. Click the**Create** button.
5. Click the**plus icon** to add new zones and resize them as desired.
6. After creating your snap layout, click the**Save & apply** button.

 You can repeat the above steps to create as many custom layouts as you want.

 By default, apps and programs on your computer will utilize[Windows 11's snap layouts](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-snap-layouts-in-windows-11/) when you move the mouse cursor over the maximize button or drag the window into a corner. To use your custom snap layout created with PowerToys, you'll need to hold the**Shift key** and then drag the window to one of your zones.

## How to Customize FancyZones Settings in PowerToys

 In addition to creating personalized snap layouts,[PowerToys offers multiple options](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-powertoys/) to customize zone appearance, modify window behavior, exclude specific apps, and more. Let’s see how to use them.

 Open PowerToys and navigate to the**FancyZones** tab. In the**Zone appearance** section, you can customize the look of zones by adjusting colors, opacity, and other aspects.

 Similarly, in the**Window behavior** section, you can use the checkboxes to specify how windows should behave when you use FancyZones. You can, for example, configure windows to revert to their original size when unsnapped using the**Restore the original size of windows when unsnapping** checkbox.

 If you’re accustomed to using**Win + arrow key** shortcut to snap windows on your computer, you can configure PowerToys to override Windows Snap. For that, enable the toggle next to**Override Windows Snap** and then use the Win + arrow keys to arrange your windows.

 With FancyZones, you can prevent specific apps and programs from snapping to zones. To do so, scroll down to the**Excluded apps** section in the FancyZones tab. Then, type in the name of the app you want to exclude. For instance, if you wanted to prevent File Explorer from snapping to zones, you’d type**explorer.exe** in the text field.
