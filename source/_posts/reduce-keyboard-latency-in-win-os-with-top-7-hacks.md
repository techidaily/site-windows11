## Reduce Keyboard Latency in Win OS with Top 7 Hacks

 A laggy-feeling keyboard can drive you up the wall, especially when you're working on something important and the keyboard refuses to cooperate. If you're a writer, web developer, programmer, or professional who spends hours punching keys, this problem can slow you down.

 Before you troubleshoot the issue, ensure that it really is the keyboard that's causing the problem. Sometimes, you may be inadvertently doing things that cause your Windows PC to slow down, which can also be a reason for keyboard input lag. However, if that's not the case, here are some easy fixes you can try to rid yourself of the annoying keyboard input lag.

## 1\. Change the Keyboard Properties

 Changing a few keyboard properties may help resolve the input lag. Here is all that you need to do:

1. Press the **Win + R** keys together and type "**control keyboard**" in the text field of the Run dialog that opens.
2. Click **Enter**. This will open the keyboard properties window, where you will see the option to adjust the **Repeat delay** and **Repeat rate**. The Repeat delay allows you to set the delay between you press-holding a key and the initiation of the repeated output of the key. The Repeat rate allows you to adjust the speed at which this output is repeated.

3. Shorten the **Repeat delay** and increase the **Repeat rate** to eliminate the input lag. This may require some experimentation before you find the sweet spot, but there's a convenient test box built right into the Keyboard properties window to help you find the right balance.
4. When you've found an ideal Repeat delay and Repeat rate, press **OK** at the bottom to save and exit.

## 2\. Update or Reinstall the Keyboard Driver

 Your system's driver tells your PC how to handle external hardware like your keyboard. If your keyboard's driver is outdated, your computer will struggle to communicate with the hardware. As such, an outdated driver is a possible cause of your keyboard input lag.

 There are a few ways to [find and replace outdated Windows drivers](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/find-replace-outdated-windows-drivers/). Here is how you can this utility to update or reinstall your keyboard driver:

1. Press the **Win** \+ **S** keys together to open the Search utility.
2. Type "Device Manager" and click **Open**.
3. Right-click on the keyboard driver and choose **Update driver** from the context menu.
4. Click on **Search automatically for drivers**. If your system has an updated version available, it will notify you, and you can proceed with installing it. .
5. Otherwise, you can choose **Search for updated drivers on Windows Update** and install the updated version if available.

1. Repeat steps 1-3 from above and choose **Browse my computer for drivers**.
2. Locate and select the updated version you just downloaded and install it.

### 1\. Replace the Batteries

 Start by ruling out the possibility of the lag being caused by a drained battery. To do this, replace the battery or recharge your keyboard to full. If this doesn't fix the problem, try the next solution.

### 2\. Check the Connection

 Start by trying to re-sync your keyboard with the USB receiver. If that doesn't help, insert the USB receiver into a different USB port on your computer if the current port lacks enough power. Try placing the keyboard closer to the USB receiver if possible.

### 3\. Remove Interference From Wireless Devices

 If you've placed other Wi-Fi devices such as a router or a cell phone near the computer, move it away and see if that eliminates the input lag.

## 7\. Consider Getting a New Keyboard

 If none of these solutions work, it could be a sign of hardware damage. So before you start searching online for [the best keyboards](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-wireless-mouse-and-keyboard/), try plugging in a different keyboard that works fine on another computer to confirm hardware damage as the cause.

 While you're waiting for your new keyboard, you can use the Windows onscreen keyboard. Search for "**onscreen keyboard**" in the Start Menu and launch the Best Match.
