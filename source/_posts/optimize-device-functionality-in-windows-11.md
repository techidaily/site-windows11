 Changing Device Usage Options on Windows is easy. There are two ways to do it - using System Settings or through a reg file. First, let's look at how to change Device Usage Options using Windows Settings.

 On the next page, look for your preferred Device Usage option and toggle it on.

## 2\. Using a REG File

 If you're [unable to open the System Settings window or if it isn't working](https://www.makeuseof.com/fixes-unable-to-open-windows-settings/), use a reg file instead. A reg file is a registry key file that helps you tweak Windows settings.

### Gaming Device Usage Options

 To create a reg file for your desired Device Usage Options, [open Notepad](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-notepad/) and copy-paste the following:

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\gaming]  
"Intent"=dword:00000001  
"Priority"=dword:00000000  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\OffDeviceConsent]  
"accepted"=dword:00000001`

 Now click the **File** menu and select **Save as** from the options list. Choose **All files** from the **Save as type** drop-down menu and save it with a **.reg** extension to your desktop.

 To apply the settings, double-click the reg file. This will turn on the Device usage options for Gaming.

 If you want to turn off this option, create a new reg file and paste the following:

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\gaming]  
"Intent"=dword:00000000`
