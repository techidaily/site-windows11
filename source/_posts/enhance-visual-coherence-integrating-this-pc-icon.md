## Enhance Visual Coherence: Integrating 'This PC' Icon

 "This PC" on Windows is a handy folder that lets you quickly access all the drives. From it, you can manage your entire system. However, it isn't readily available on the desktop most of the time. This is why accessing it through File Explorer can feel tiresome, especially if you need to access it ten times a day.

 If accessing the "This PC" folder from File Explorer feels cumbersome, here's how you can move it directly to your desktop.

## How to Add the "This PC" Icon to Your Windows Desktop

 To add the "This PC" icon to your Windows 11 desktop, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the Windows**Start** button and open**Settings** .
2. Navigate to the**Personalization** tab in the left sidebar.
3. Go to**Themes** in the right pane.

4. Click on**Desktop icon settings** under**Related settings** .

5. In the**Desktop Icon Settings** window, check the box beside**Computer** .
6. Then, click on**Apply** and hit**OK** .

 That's all. Following the above steps will add the "This PC" icon to your desktop. If you wish to remove the icon again, follow the same steps outlined above, but this time uncheck the box beside**Computer** (that you checked), click**Apply** , and hit**OK** .

 Similar to how we have added the "This PC" icon, you can [add other icons to your desktop in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-icon-to-desktop-windows/) , such as Recycle Bin, Network, and Control Panel.

 Don't restore the icon settings after making this change. This will reverse our recent change, and the "This PC" icon will again disappear.

If you decide to clean up your desktop in the future, follow the same steps and disable it again.
