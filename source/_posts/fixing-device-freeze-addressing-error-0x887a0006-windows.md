## Fixing Device Freeze: Addressing Error 0X887A0006 Windows

 Many Windows gaming enthusiasts have reported that they're encountering a DXGI\_ERROR\_DEVICE\_HUNG error. This error regularly crashes some players’ games shortly after starting them or when they’re playing. It displays an error message window that includes a 0x887A0006 code and says, “A problem has occurred with your display driver.”

 Microsoft has described the DXGI\_ERROR\_DEVICE\_HUNG error to be a command communication issue between system hardware and games. This error is a big deal when it keeps crashing affected Windows games. However, players have resolved the 0x887A0006 error with these potential fixes.

## 1\. Set Affected Games to Run With Administrator Rights

 Make sure the games that error 0x887A0006 crashes have full system access by running them with administrator rights. You can temporarily select to run a game with admin rights or set it to always run with elevated privileges. This is how you can configure an affected game to run as an administrator:

1. First, bring up Windows 11’s file manager with a method in our [guide for opening Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/).
2. Then open the installation folder that contains the game’s EXE (application file).
3. Right-click the game’s EXE file and select **Properties**.
4. Click the properties window’s **Compatibility** tab.
5. Select **Run this game as administrator** to give the game elevated privileges.

6. To save the settings, press the **Apply** button.
7. Then try playing your affected game to see if this potential solution makes a difference.

## 2\. Select Debug Mode in the NVIDIA Control Panel

 Some players have fixed the 0x887A0006 error by selecting **Debug Mode** in the NVIDIA Control Panel. That option disables GPU (graphical processing unit) overclocking. If your PC has an NVIDIA graphics card, you can select the **Debug Mode** option as follows:

1. Right-click the desktop area and select **NVIDIA Control Panel**.
2. Click the **Help** menu.

## 5\. Roll Back the Most Recent Graphics Driver Update

 A few players have said they fixed error 0x887A0006 by rolling back graphics drivers. Applying such a resolution will restore the previous graphics driver installed on your PC. If the file for your previous graphics driver remains saved, you can select to roll back the driver via Device Manager.

## 6\. Update Your GPU’s Driver

 The 0x887A0006 error message explicitly says that an issue has occurred with your PC’s display (graphics) adapter. That could mean there’s an outdated graphics driver on your PC that isn’t compatible with affected games. The probable solution in such a scenario is to update the driver for your PC’s GPU.

 You can update an NVIDIA or AMD driver in a few different ways. Some users utilize driver updater software packages, but some of them don't update graphics drivers to the newest ones available. To ensure you’re installing the very latest driver available for your GPU, download it from the manufacturer’s website.

 Our guide for [updating your graphics drivers on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) provides further details about the various methods.
