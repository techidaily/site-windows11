## Personalizing Window' Writable Wallpaper with Confidence

 Windows Spotlight automatically displays images of scenic landscapes, nature, animals, and more on your lock screen and desktop. But what if you don't like a Spotlight image someday?

 Fortunately, you don't need to wait a day for the Spotlight image to change. You can switch to the next Spotlight picture when you want with this guide.

## How to Switch to a New Windows Spotlight Picture on Your Desktop

 It's as easy as a few clicks to[set up Windows Spotlight for your desktop](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-spotlight-wallpaper/) and enjoy beautiful images. However, you cannot control or choose the image that Windows Spotlight will display on your desktop.

 If you don't like the Spotlight image on a particular day, you're not stuck with it on your desktop. You can switch to the next Spotlight picture easily.

1. You'll see a**camera icon** on your desktop on the top right with**Learn more about this picture** text. Right-click this**camera icon** .
2. From the options that drop down, click on**Switch to next picture** . And you'll get the next Spotlight picture on your desktop.

 Not only will the picture change, but it will be of a different theme or category from the previous one. For example, if the Spotlight picture you don't like is showing a natural landscape, the next picture it will select could be of animals in a wildlife reserve.
