## Ideal Guide: Efficiently Change HEIC Images to JPEG Format on Windows 11

 HEIC is an Apple image format used on iPhones. It enables higher-quality images in smaller file sizes. Apple established HEIC in 2017, now among the more prevalent image formats after JPEG and PNG.

 However, few Windows software packages support the HEIC format. Some users prefer to convert HEIC images to JPEG format so they can open iPhone photos on PCs with many more Windows apps. Batch conversion is preferable since it enables you to convert multiple HEIC images simultaneously. This is how you can batch-convert HEIC images to JPEG in Windows 11/10.

## How to Batch Convert HEIC Images to JPEG With CopyTrans HEIC for Windows

 CopyTrans HEIC for Windows is software that adds a convenient HEIC to JPEG conversion option to File Explorer’s context menu. Then you can select multiple HEIC images in Explorer and convert them to JPEG by right-clicking the files.

 Aside from that, installing this software also enables you to preview HEIC images in Explorer without converting them. You can convert multiple HEIC images to JPEG with CopyTrans as follows:

1. Open this[CopyTrans HEIC for Windows](https://www.copytrans.net/copytransheic/#down) download page.
2. Click CopyTrans HEIC’s**Download** button and downloaded the executable.
3. Double-click the**CopyTransHEICforWindowsv2.000.exe** file.
4. Click**Next** to proceed to the software agreement options for CopyTrans HEIC.
5. Select the**I accept** radio button for the terms of use agreement and click**Next** .
6. Click the**I am installing CopyTrans HEIC for home use** checkbox to select that option.

7. Then select**Next** \>**Install** to add the new HEIC conversion context menu option.

 Now that CopyTrans HEIC is installed, it's time to convert your files:

1. Open Explorer after installing CopyTrans HEIC (there’s no need for a restart Windows).
2. Bring up a folder that contains some HEIC images you want to convert.
3. Hold the**Ctrl** key to[select multiple HEIC files](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-select-multiple-files/) within Explorer.
4. Right-click on one of the selected image files to select**Convert to JPEG With CopyTrans** . Windows 11 users need to select**Show more options** \>**Convert to JPEG** .  
![The Convert to JPEG with CopyTrans option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/convert-to-jpeg-option.jpg)

 Then CopyTrans will convert the selected images to JPEG format without any kind of confirmation window popping up. It will save new JPG files for the HEIC images in the same folder. You’ll need to click on a different folder and then return to the directory that includes the HEIC images to see new files.

 CopyTrans HEIC for Windows doesn’t have any kind of user interface. So, there isn’t any way you can configure what folder converted output gets saved in or change any other settings.

 With CopyTrans installed, you can enable HEIC image previews in Windows 11 File Explorer by clicking the**View** command bar button. Select**Show** \>**Preview pane** on the menu. In Windows 10, you can select**Preview Pane** on the**View** tab. Then selecting a HEIC image will show a sidebar preview of it.
