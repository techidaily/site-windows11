 Windows is designed for general computer use, not specifically for gaming. The Windows key, Alt+Tab, and other keyboard shortcuts like Sticky Keys can pull you out of full-screen games and bring you back to the desktop. Luckily, it's very easy to disable them, so you can enjoy uninterrupted gaming sessions.

##  How to Disable the Windows Key

 There are a couple of methods by which you can disable the Windows key on your Windows PC. Let's check out all the methods in detail:

###  Using the Registry Editor

 One of the best ways to disable the Windows key on your computer is by using the Registry Editor. However, before you begin, it's important to [back up the registry](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/quick-start-guide-dells-simple-screen-recording-methods-for-2024/) and [create a restore point](https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-multiplying-joy-sharing-a-pile-of-photos-and-videos-with-instagram/). This will ensure that your data remains safe even if something goes wrong during the editing process.

 With that said, open the Start menu, type **Registry Editor** in the search bar, and press Enter.

 In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following location:

        `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout`
    
 Right-click the "Keyboard Layout" key, select "New," and choose "Binary Value." Then, name the value "Scancode Map."

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Right-click on the "Scancode Map" value and select "Modify."

![Modify option for the Scancode binary value.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/modify-option-for-the-scancode-binary-value.jpg) 

 Type the following value in the "Value Data" field and click "OK."

        `00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00  
03, 00, 00, 00, 00, 00, 5B, E0,  
00, 00, 5C, E0, 00, 00, 00, 00`

 Afterward, [restart your computer](https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-15-must-use-hashtags-for-popularity-on-instagram-feed/), and you'll find that the Windows key is no longer functioning. To re-enable the Windows key in the future, simply delete the "Scancode Map" binary value from the Registry Editor, and the Windows key will start working again.

 If you have Windows Pro or Enterprise edition, you can use the Local Group Policy Editor to disable the Windows key on your computer.

###  Using Your Keyboard Software

 If you have a [gaming keyboard](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-12-prominent-oppo-fingerprint-not-working-solutions-by-drfone-android/), it likely has dedicated software that lets you configure how the keys work. Most gaming keyboards also have a gaming mode that, when enabled, disables keys that might interrupt your gaming session, including the Windows key.

 For example, if you have an Alienware keyboard, you can use the Fn+F6 key combination to enable gaming mode. If you're unaware of the key combination for your keyboard, check the user manual for more information.

##  How to Disable the Alt+Tab Shortcut

 Pressing Alt+Tab opens the app switcher, which lets you see and switch between different programs running on your computer. However, you might not want to hit this key combination during an intense gaming session because it will minimize your game. You can prevent this from happening by temporarily disabling this shortcut.
