## Techniques for Tranquil Application Management in Window 11

 Background apps in Windows continue to perform actions such as updates and fetch up-to-date data even when you are not using them. While Windows can intelligently manage and power-optimize background apps, it can still drain your battery and increase data usage.

 Fortunately, Windows lets you change the background permission for individual Microsoft Store apps. Here we show you how to disable individual or all background apps in Windows 11\.

## 1\. How to Disable Background Apps via the Settings App

 If you want to disable individual Microsoft Store apps from running in the background, you can disable it from the Settings page. Follow the below steps to disable background apps from Settings.

1. Press **Win + I** to open the **Settings** app.
2. Open the **Apps** tab in the left pane.
3. Click on **Installed apps** in the right pane and search to locate the app for which you want to change the background permission.
4. Click the **three-dots menu** icon next to the app name and select **Advanced options.** If the option is not available, then the app does not support the background app permission management feature.

6. Click the drop-down for **Let this app run in background** and select **Never**. This should disable the app from running in the background.

 By default, the background permission for the app is set to **Power optimized(recommended)**. This means Windows will decide when the app can run in the background to save more power. If you set it to **Always**, the app will continuously run in the background irrespective of your power status.

## 2\. How to Disable Background Apps via Power & Battery Settings

2. In the **System** tab, scroll down and click on **Power & battery.**

5. To change the background app permission, click the **three-dots menu** beside the app name, and click on **Manage background productivity**. This option is only available for Microsoft Store apps.
6. Click the **drop-down** (**Power optimized**) under the **Background apps permissions** section and select **Never**. This will disable the app from running in the background.

 In addition to disabling background apps, try to create and use [custom Windows power plans to extend your laptop battery life](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/save-energy-extend-battery-life-custom-windows-power-plans/). With custom power plans, you can tweak your processor and other components to configure low-power modes to achieve an improved battery life.

## 3\. How to Disable Background Apps for the Current User

 If you want, you can disable background apps for the individual user. Useful if you share your PC with multiple users at work or home. Also useful if you need to disable a non-Microsoft third-party app from running in the background.

 For this, you will need to create a registry file and run it with administrative privilege. Before you proceed, [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/). You can use the restore point to revert your PC to its previous state if something goes wrong when editing the registry entries.

 To disable background apps for the current user:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the **Run** dialog.
2. Type **notepad** and click **OK** to open the text editor app.  
![disable background apps windows 11 registry editor](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/disable-background-apps-windows-11-registry-editor.jpg)
3. In the Notepad file, copy and paste the following content:  
`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\BackgroundAccessApplications]  
"GlobalUserDisabled"=dword:00000001  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Search]  
"BackgroundAppGlobalToggle"=dword:00000000`
4. Next, press **Win + S** to open the **Save** dialog.
5. Here, name the file as **Disable\_Background\_Apps\_for\_current\_user.reg**. Then, click the **Save as type** drop-down and select **All Files.**  
![disable background apps windows 11 registry editor save](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/disable-background-apps-windows-11-registry-editor-save.jpg)
6. Click the **Save** button to save the file.
7. Right-click on the newly created reg file and select **Open.** Click **Yes** to confirm and modify the registry entries to disable background apps.
8. If the script runs without error, restart your PC to apply the changes.

 The above script modifies the two DWORD values, **GlobalUserDisabled** and **BackgroundAppGlobalToggle,** setting them to **1** and **0**, respectively. Modifying the GlobalUserDisabled value prevents background access to applications.

 Similarly, changes to the BackgroundAppGlobalToggle turn off the toggle for background apps in Windows search, thus limiting its background access.

 If you need to turn on background apps for the current user, then save the following script as **enable\_background\_apps.reg** and run it as administrator.

![reg file content background app disable](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/reg-file-content-background-app-disable.png)

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\BackgroundAccessApplications]  
"GlobalUserDisabled"=-  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Search]  
"BackgroundAppGlobalToggle"=-`

## 4\. How to Disable Background Apps for All Users Using Registry Editor

 Windows allows you to configure background app permission for the Microsoft Store apps. You can disable these apps to conserve battery and avoid unnecessary data usage on a metered connection.
