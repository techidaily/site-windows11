## NotepadDarkSettingsInstructionsWin10/11

 In recent years, dark modes in apps and operating systems have become more prevalent, mostly because the aesthetic is more pleasing and easier on the eyes when the sun sets.

 Windows comes with a dark theme that improves the overall aesthetic of the system. However, this option is limited and does not affect certain apps. One such app is the Notepad app, on which you must enable the dark mode manually.

 In this guide, we will discuss the steps of enabling Dark Mode in Notepad and Notepad++ in detail. It is incredibly easy to make these changes and revert them.

## How to Enable Dark Mode in Notepad on Windows 10

 If you're unsure about this feature, read our guide on [what dark mode really is and how it works](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-dark-mode-and-how-does-it-work/) before we get into the nitty gritty of enabling it.

 The simplest way of enabling dark mode in Notepad on Windows 10 is by modifying the Ease of Access settings in the Settings app. If you do not wish to enable that feature, then you can download a similar third-party application using the Microsoft Store.

Whichever method you prefer, we will cover both methods in detail.

### 1\. Modify the Ease of Access Settings

 The easiest route to enabling dark mode in Notepad on Windows 10 is by enabling the High contrast feature in the Ease of Access settings. However, this feature might not be suitable for everyone.

 High contrast is a feature of Windows specifically designed for visually impaired users. It hides the background images and certain UI controls like buttons are filled with bright colors to make navigation easier. This mode changes the entire theme of Windows to black, while the text remains white.

Here is how you can enable it:

1. Press**Win** +**I** to open Windows Settings.
2. Choose**Ease of Access** in the following window.
3. Choose the**High contrast** option from the left pane.
4. Turn the toggle on for**Turn on high contrast** .

 Your system will take a few seconds to apply these changes. Once that is done, you can launch the notepad to see if the changes are applied.

### 2\. Download a Third-Party Alternative

 As we mentioned earlier, the high contrast feature might not be for everyone. If you do not want to enable it, then you can download a third-party alternative using the Microsoft Store.

 The most popular option is the [Black Notepad app](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/black-notepad/9P20VW17VMPK?hl=en-us&gl=US) , whose functionality is almost similar to that of the default notepad in Windows. It is available for free in the Microsoft Store, so you can download and start using it in no time.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 You can also look for other options online with advanced functionality if you use Notepad on a regular basis.

 In case you have downloaded a third-party text editor and wish to continue using it instead of Notepad, you should make it your default editor. For this, right-click on any text file and choose**Open with** \>**Choose another app** .

![Choose another app to open file](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/open-with-choose-another-app.jpg)

 Choose the targeted app in the following dialog and checkmark the box for "Always use this app to open .txt files."

## How to Enable Dark Mode in Notepad on Windows 11

 The new Windows operating system also allows users to [enable and customize dark mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-dark-mode/) on their systems, just like Windows 10 does. If you are a Windows 11 user, then follow one of the methods below to enable dark mode in your Notepad.

### 1\. Use the Settings App

 In this method, we will be switching to dark system mode. However, if the Notepad on your Windows is not configured to use the system theme, then these changes will not work for you. In that case, you can proceed with the next method below.

Here is how you can make the changes within the Settings app:

1. Press**Win** +**I** to open the Settings app.
2. Choose**Personalization** from the left pane.
3. Click on**Colors** in the following window.  
![Color settings in Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/personalization-colors-1.jpg)
4. Expand the dropdown for**Choose your mode** and choose**Dark** from the context menu.  
![Dark mode option in Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/choose-your-mode-dark.jpg)

 You can now launch the Notepad and check if the dark mode has been enabled successfully. If not, try following the steps in the next method.

### 2\. Modify the Notepad Settings

 In this method, we will be changing the Notepad theme to dark by accessing the Settings option within the application.

Follow these steps to proceed:

1. Launch Notepad and click on the**gear icon** on the top right.
2. In the following window, click on the**App theme** option.
3. Choose**Dark** from the options and see if the changes have been made successfully.  
![Notepad settings in Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/notepad2-1.jpg)

 This should enable the dark mode in Notepad successfully. Nevertheless, in Windows 11 as well, you can install third-party applications from the Microsoft Store or other sources if you cannot follow the aforementioned methods for some reason.

 To undo these changes, simply follow the steps listed above again and choose the**Light** or**Use System setting** option from the list available. This should return the Notepad back to the light mode but if you are unable to do so, head over to our [guide on how to fix a Windows device that is stuck in dark mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-device-stuck-dark-mode/) .

## How to Enable Dark Theme in Notepad++

 Notepad ++ is the classic Notepad on steroids. This text editor is developed by Microsoft and offers a handful of advanced features that are not available in the classic Notepad.

 You can work with around 80 different programming languages in this text editor, as well as launch multiple files at the same time.

 If you are using Notepad ++, here is how you can enable the dark theme in the app:

1. Launch Notepad ++ and head over to**Settings** \>**Style Configurator** .  
![Style configurator](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/notepad-settings-style-configurator.jpg)
2. In the following window, expand the dropdown for**Select theme** and choose**Deep Black** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. You can customize the app further by changing the overall style of the app, fonts, and colors. Once you are done, click on**Save & Close** .

 Your Notepad ++ app should display the dark mode now. Don’t forget to set it as the default text editor by following the steps we highlighted above.
