## Addressing Faulty Display Settings via Nonfunctional Fn Button in Windows 11

 You may usually get eye strain or headaches when the brightness of your laptop or PC monitor is too low. Issues like this can be easily solved by adjusting the brightness with a simple press of the brightness function key.

## 9\. Switch to a Different Keyboard

 Sometimes the problem is not others but the keyboard itself. It could have defective keys or some other hardware issue preventing it from functioning correctly; in that case, try using your device on another computer or laptop to be sure that the problem is not the operating system or software.

 If you find that your keyboard is the issue, then it’s time to replace it with a new one or get it repaired.
