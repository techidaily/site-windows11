## Relax High Contrast Aesthetics in Window OS

 Microsoft first introduced high-contrast themes with Windows 7\. The idea was to add a theme that helps users with low vision or photosensitivity see screen elements better. But not everyone needs the high contrast mode on Windows 11 or older versions. Maybe you turned it on by accident and are now struggling to turn it off.

 High contrast mode makes the screen elements darker to increase clarity, but the result may not look inviting for every user. As such, we will explore multiple methods to turn off the high contrast mode on Windows 11 or older operating systems.

## What Is High Contrast Mode?

 High Contrast Mode is an accessibility feature that comes free with Windows. It makes certain screen elements darker and more distinguishable so that users with low vision can see everything. High contrast mode isn’t limited to Windows only; you can also find it in Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and more.

 But there is a dark mode on Windows 11, isn't there? So, why do we need high-contrast themes? It is because dark mode can reduce the strain on the eyes and is helpful for users who don’t have problems with their vision. But dark mode makes everything black except the text and people with low vision may struggle with it.

 High contrast themes offer customizability to tweak different screen elements, like text, links, background, button text, and more. It's a lot more helpful than dark mode, which just adds a dark or black-grayish background with a white color.
