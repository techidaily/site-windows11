## Windows Insight: Essential Steps for Gauging Network Bandwidth

 The network adapter is a critical piece of hardware that connects your Windows computer to the internet via a wired or wireless connection. In order to achieve the maximum speeds offered by your Internet Service Provider, it is important to know what network speed your card is capable of.

2. Select**Network & internet** from the left sidebar.
3. Click on**Properties** at the top.
