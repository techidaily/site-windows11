## Expert Tips: Adjusting WinOS's Hardware-Assisted Scheduler Settings

 If you were looking for new ways to get more out of your hardware, chances are you’ve enabled the Hardware accelerated GPU scheduling feature on your computer. While it’s supposed to improve your computer’s performance, it might have a negative effect, if your GPU is a bit older.

 In this case, should you disable it? But how can you turn off Hardware accelerated GPU scheduling in Windows 10 and 11?

## What Is Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling?

 Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling is a feature designed to reduce the load on your CPU during intensive tasks. Usually, the CPU assigns the graphics-intensive data to the GPU, so games, media-playing apps, or editing software run smoothly. To do so, the CPU gathers, assigns, and sets the priority for each task so the GPU can render it.

 When the hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling feature is enabled, the dedicated GPU-based scheduler will handle the high-priority tasks. This way, the CPU can execute more tasks in the same amount of time.

## Should You Disable Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling?

 Most of the time, [GPU hardware scheduling is worth turning on in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-gpu-hardware-scheduling-worth-turning-on/), especially if your computer isn’t equipped with one of the latest GPU models. But enabling the GPU scheduling feature can also backfire, and have a negative impact on your computer’s performance. For example, on an older GPU, it might cause latency between the frames or even significant lag while gaming.

 Also, GPU scheduling is known for causing conflict with Windows services, such as dxgmms2.sys, which helps render graphics, especially during gaming sessions. So, if you keep running into the [dxgmms2.sys error in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-dxgmms2-sys-error-fix/), you’ll have to disable the Hardware- accelerated GPU scheduling feature.

 In addition to this, the feature might encounter compatibility issues with specific hardware or software. So, you have to turn off GPU scheduling to keep your computer running smoothly.
