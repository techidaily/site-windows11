## Breaking Through Windows TPM Restrictions with Ease

 The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a security chip that safeguards your computer against malware and other attacks. It plays a crucial role in the installation of Windows 11 and is also an integral part of several security features like Windows Hello and BitLocker.

 If you need to clear the TPM for any reason, you've come to the right place. This guide features four ways to clear TPM on Windows 11\.

## When Should You Clear TPM, and Is It Safe to Do So?

 While TPM safeguards sensitive data and thwarts hacking attempts generated through a computer's hardware, below are a few instances when you should clear TPM on your computer.

* If you [checked your computer for malware](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/computer-virus-signs/) and suspect it has been infected, resetting the TPM will eradicate any malware that burrowed into it.
* The TPM stores crucial information about drivers and applications installed on your computer. Therefore, you must reset the TPM before selling your computer to protect your privacy.
* Clearing the TPM can also help you troubleshoot problems related to security, encryption, and authentication.
* You should clear the TPM before clean installing a new operating system. This way, the OS can fully deploy its TPM-based functionalities like attestation.

 It's completely safe to clear TPM on your computer. However, remember that this action will erase all encrypted keys generated by the TPM and the associated protected data. This data contains information related to virtual smart cards or sign-in PINs.

 As such, it's crucial to [back up your Windows data](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-windows-computer-cloud/) that's protected by the TPM to prevent any data loss.

## 1\. How to Clear the TPM Using the TPM Management Console

 The TPM management console allows you to manage the TPM installed on your computer. You can use it to [enable or disable TPM](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-enable-tpm-secure-boot-before-upgrading-windows-11/), clear TPM, and manage TPM keys.

 To use it to clear or reset TPM, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + R** keys together to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **tpm.msc** in the search bar and press Enter.
3. Click the **Clear TPM** option in the Actions section.

## 4\. How to Clear the TPM Through the BIOS

 You can configure your computer's security layers, including the TPM from the BIOS. Below are the steps to reset TPM from the BIOS:

1. Restart your computer and press the BIOS key (usually F2 or Del key) to access the BIOS menu.
2. Switch to the **Security** tab.  
![Security tab in the BIOS Menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/security-tab-1.jpg)
3. Click the **Clear TPM** option and choose **Yes** from the prompt.
