## Enabling Elevated Privileges for Power Users: A Guide

 Command Prompt is one of the most powerful tools available in the Windows operating system. It provides a command-line interface for running scripts and commands to access hidden features and perform administrative tasks. Unfortunately, there have been reports of trouble running Command Prompt as an administrator.

 If you are experiencing the same problem, don't worry - there's an easy fix. In this blog post, we'll show you how to resolve the problem of Command Prompt not running as an administrator in Windows 11.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 If you are having trouble running Command Prompt as an administrator, try restarting your computer first. This simple step can often solve many of your issues since it will reset the faulty settings and clear out any temporary files that may be causing problems.

## 2\. Create a Command Prompt Desktop Shortcut

1. Right-click on your desktop and select**New > Shortcut** .

5. Then select the**Advanced option** in the resulting window.
6. Check the**Run as administrator** box, then click**OK** to save your changes.

 Once you performed the above steps, double-click on Command Prompt Admin to open Command Prompt as an administrator.

 Now that Command Prompt is running as an administrator, you don't have to worry about Command Prompt not working correctly.

## 2\. Create a New User Account

 If it prevents you from creating a shortcut for Command Prompt, you may have to create a new user account. To do this, follow these steps:

3. From here, click on the**Add a new user in PC settings** link and follow the steps to create a new user account with administrative privileges.

 Once you have your new admin account set up, log in with it and launch Command Prompt again as an administrator - this should fix the issue. When you still can't get it to run, try restarting your computer before trying any of the other solutions listed here.

## 4\. Check for Any New Windows Updates

 Windows Update is a critical component of keeping your computer up to date. As such, if Command Prompt fails to run as an administrator, check for any new Windows updates.

 To do this, open your Start menu, then type "Check for updates" in the search bar. Afterward, click on the search result and install any pending updates found. Once you have done so, restart your computer, and Command Prompt should work properly.

## 5\. Perform a System Restore

 If you have recently made changes to Command Prompt, and they seem to be causing the issue, you can try performing a system restore. This will revert your computer back to a previous point in time when Command Prompt was still working properly.
