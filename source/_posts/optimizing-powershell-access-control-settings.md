## Optimizing PowerShell Access Control Settings

 Command Prompt is one of the most powerful tools available in the Windows operating system. It provides a command-line interface for running scripts and commands to access hidden features and perform administrative tasks. Unfortunately, there have been reports of trouble running Command Prompt as an administrator.

 If you are experiencing the same problem, don't worry - there's an easy fix. In this blog post, we'll show you how to resolve the problem of Command Prompt not running as an administrator in Windows 11.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 If you are having trouble running Command Prompt as an administrator, try restarting your computer first. This simple step can often solve many of your issues since it will reset the faulty settings and clear out any temporary files that may be causing problems.

## 2\. Create a Command Prompt Desktop Shortcut

 If you prefer, you can create a[desktop shortcut](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-desktop-shortcut-how-work/) that executes the Command Prompt with elevated privileges. Here's how to do it:

1. Right-click on your desktop and select**New > Shortcut** .

2. Copy and paste the following into the location box then click**Next** .  
C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe
3. Name the shortcut Command Prompt Admin or something similar and then click**Finish** to save it.
4. Right-click on the Command Prompt shortcut icon and select**Properties** from the menu that appears.

5. Then select the**Advanced option** in the resulting window.
6. Check the**Run as administrator** box, then click**OK** to save your changes.

 Once you performed the above steps, double-click on Command Prompt Admin to open Command Prompt as an administrator.

 Now that Command Prompt is running as an administrator, you don't have to worry about Command Prompt not working correctly.

## 2\. Create a New User Account

 If it prevents you from creating a shortcut for Command Prompt, you may have to create a new user account. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the Control Panel. Check out[how to open the Control Panel](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-control-panel/) if you get stuck.  
![Manage another account using Control Panel](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/manage-another-account-using-control-panel.jpg)

3. From here, click on the**Add a new user in PC settings** link and follow the steps to create a new user account with administrative privileges.

## 4\. Check for Any New Windows Updates

 Windows Update is a critical component of keeping your computer up to date. As such, if Command Prompt fails to run as an administrator, check for any new Windows updates.

 To do this, open your Start menu, then type "Check for updates" in the search bar. Afterward, click on the search result and install any pending updates found. Once you have done so, restart your computer, and Command Prompt should work properly.
