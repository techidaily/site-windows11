## Get Your PC's Virtual Machine Game Strong with Hyper-V

 Hyper-V is Microsoft's in-house virtualization solution for Windows 11\. It lets you create virtual machines and run them on virtual hardware. That said, if you want to use Hyper-V on your computer, you will need to enable it first.

 In this article, we show you the how to enable Hyper-V in Windows 11 and create virtual machines without third-party tools.

## What Are the Use Cases for Hyper-V?

 Hyper-V is a native virtualization tool that allows you to run multiple operating systems on your system virtually without affecting your host OS.

 With Hyper-V, you don’t have to rely on third-party hypervisor solutions such as VirtualBox and VMware Workstation. [Hyper-V has plenty of use cases for individuals](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reasons-start-using-virtual-machine/), and even more for organizations.

 Some Hyper-V virtual machine use cases include:

* Run and test software for an older version of Windows or non-Windows OS
* Test software on multiple operating systems using multiple virtual machines on a single host system.
* Offers disaster recovery features including live migration and failover clustering for increased uptime.
* Create and run virtual machines in isolation for improved security.

## Prerequisites to Enable Hyper-V on Windows 11

![check Windows 11 edition](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/check-Windows-11-edition.png)

 Hyper-V is available as an optional feature on Windows 11 Pro, Enterprise, and Education. To check your edition of Windows, go to **Settings > System > About**. Then, check the **Windows specifications** section to find your Windows edition.

 If you have the Home edition, here’s how to [install Hyper-V on Windows 11 Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/install-hyper-v-windows-11-home/). All you have to do is run a bat script to install Hyper-V on non-compatible systems.

 Depending on how many virtual machines and types of applications you intend to run, you may need more resources to run the virtual machines smoothly.

 In addition, you need to enable Hardware Virtualization in BIOS. It is an essential feature to run virtual machines on your Windows system but often disabled by default.
