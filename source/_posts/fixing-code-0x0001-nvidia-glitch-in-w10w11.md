## Fixing Code 0X0001 Nvidia Glitch in W10/W11

 GeForce Experience is a useful app that can help you optimize games if you own a PC with an NVIDIA GPU. However, an error with the code "0x0001" prevents some users from utilizing GeForce Experience, and it comes with a message that just reads, “Something went wrong.”

 If your GeForce Experience suffers from the 0x0001 error code, you'll be totally unable to run it. As such, this is how you can get error 0x0001 fixed for GeForce Experience on Windows 10 and 11.

## 1\. Check If All the Required NVIDIA Services are Enabled and Running

 The 0x0001 error can appear because certain NVIDIA services required by GeForce Experience aren’t enabled and running. There are numerous NVIDIA services you need to check, so here's how to do so:

1. To access the search box, press**Win + S** .
2. Enter**Services** in the file and app search utility.
3. Click the**Services** app the search tool finds.
4. Then double-click the NVIDIA Display Container LS service.  
![The NVIDIA services](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nvidia-services.jpg)
5. If the NVIDIA Display Container LS service is disabled, select**Automatic** on its**Startup Type** menu.
6. Click the NVIDIA Display Container LS service’s**Start** button to run it.  
![The NVIDIA Display Container LS Properties window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/nvidia-display-container-properties-window.jpg)
7. Press the properties window’s**Apply** button and click**OK** .
8. Repeat steps five to seven for the NVIDIA Telemetry Container and NVIDIA LocalSystem Container services.

 Also, check and start the NVIDIA NetworkService Container, GeForce Experience Service, and Geforce Experience Backend Service if you can find them. However, set those services with the following startup options:

* NVIDIA Geforce Experience Backend –**Automatic (Delayed Start)**
* NVIDIA GeForce Experience –**Automatic (Delayed Start)**
* NVIDIA NetworkService Container –**Manual**

 If all those NVIDIA services are already running, you can restart them instead. Right-click an NVIDIA service and select**Stop** . Then right-click it again to select its**Start** option.

## 2\. Allow the NVIDIA Container Services to Interact With the Desktop

 Some GeForce Experience users have confirmed that allowing NVIDIA container services to interact with the desktop can fix error 0x0001\. Those users selected an**Allow service to interact with a desktop** setting for NVIDIA services. This is how you can select that option in Windows 11/10:

1. Open Services as instructed in steps one to three above.
2. Double-click**NVIDIA Display Container** in the Services window.
3. Select the**Log On** tab.
4. Click the**Local System Account** radio button if that option isn’t currently selected.  
![The Log on tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-log-on-tab.jpg)
5. Select the**Allow service to interact with desktop** checkbox.
6. Click**Apply** \>**OK** to set the new log-on option.
7. Repeat steps two to six for the NVIDIA Telemetry Container, NVIDIA NetworkService Container, and NVIDIA LocalSystem Container services.

## 3\. Edit the CurrentVersion Key in the Windows Registry

 Error 0x0001 can be caused by a registry anomaly for the**CurrentVersion** key. Users have been able to fix the issue by adding missing backslashes to the data values for a couple of strings in that key. You can apply this potential resolution in the following steps:

1. Find Registry Editor by activating the Windows search box and inputting a**regedit** keyword there.
2. Click**Registry Editor** in the search results to open Regedit. See[how to open Regedit](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-registry-editor/) for more methods.
3. Clear the current registry location in Regedit’s address bar.
4. Open the**CurrentVersion** key by entering this location in the address bar and pressing**Return** :  
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion`
5. Then double-click the**ProgramFilesDir** string.  
![The ProgramFilesDir strings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/programfiles-strings.jpg)

1. The correct value for the**ProgramFilesDir** string is**C:\\Program Files** . If a backslash is missing in that data, input**C:\\Program Files** in the**Value** box.  
![The Edit String window for the ProgramFilesDir string](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/edit-string-window.jpg)
2. Select**OK** to set the new value.
3. Double-click the**ProgramFilesDir (x86)** string.
4. The value for this string should be set to**C:\\Program Files (x86)** . Add a backslash to that string value if one is missing, and click the**OK** option.

5. Restart Windows after editing the**CurrentVersion** registry key.

## 6\. Reinstall the NVIDIA Graphics Driver

 If you don’t need to update your graphics driver, consider reinstalling the current one instead. You can uninstall an NVIDIA driver with the Display Driver Uninstaller utility. Our guide about[how to cleanly install and reinstall graphics drivers](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-cleanly-install-and-reinstall-gpu-drivers-on-windows/) includes instructions on how to utilize that tool.

 To get a replacement driver, open the[NVIDIA download page](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) . Select your graphics card model and OS version on the drop-down menus there, and click the**Search** option. Click**Download** to get the latest driver package for your GPU. Then you can double-click the downloaded NVIDIA driver file to open the installer and reinstall the driver.

## 7\. Uninstall Any Active VPN Software

 If you’re utilizing VPN software, that could be causing a connection breakdown for GeForce Experience. Consider at least disabling the VPN before trying to access the NVIDIA app again. However, uninstalling the VPN software via Program and Features will more likely resolve GeForce Experience issues caused by it.
