### Key Takeaways

* Windows 11 has a centered taskbar with new animations and icons, but customization options are limited.
* The Start Menu in Windows 11 is controversial due to the removal of Live Tiles and the addition of a Recommended section.
* Windows 11 features an enhanced Widgets panel with more functionality and a new design, as well as improved Snap Layouts for multitasking.

 Windows 11 is Microsoft’s most recent Windows release, and with it comes a lot of promises and changes from Microsoft. From a fresh, modern look to brand-new features, Windows 11 is quite a bit different than Windows 10\.

 While most of these differences are cosmetic, there are some notable changes that Microsoft has implemented in its new OS.

 Let’s take a look at the biggest differences between Windows 10 and Windows 11\.

## Windows 11 Has a Centered Taskbar

 When you first boot up Windows 11, the first thing you'll notice is the centered taskbar. Compared to the left-oriented taskbar of Windows 10, the taskbar in Windows 11 looks more like something from macOS.

 Aside from the positional changes, the Windows 11 taskbar has lost and gained a couple of major features. For instance, you can’t make it taller. Also, unlike Windows 10, you can’t move the taskbar around the screen.

![Pin App to Windows 11 Taskbar From Desktop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Pin-App-to-Taskbar-From-Desktop.jpg)

 Moreover, you also lose the ability to make the taskbar icons smaller in Windows 11, something you could do in Windows 10\. However, if you want the Start button to be on the left side, you can [personalize the Windows 11 taskbar](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-personalize-taskbar/) to move the button to where it is on Windows 10\.

 That said, Microsoft has tried to give the taskbar a significant touchup. There are new animations for launching, minimizing, and maximizing apps. There are also new icons for **Search**, **Start Menu**, **Widgets**, and **Chat**.

## Windows 11 Has a Very Different Start Menu

 Perhaps the most controversial change, the Start Menu from Windows 10 is gone, and Microsoft has replaced it with a centered, stripped-down version without Live Tiles on Windows 11\.

 Live Tiles are a big part of the Windows 10 Start Menu. When Microsoft removed them from Windows 11, the company got a vocal response from both sides of the camp. People who loved Live Tiles’ ability to deliver information at a glance, lamented their loss. On the other hand, people who never used them praised their removal.

![Windows 11 Start menu on colorful desktop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/windows-11-start-menu-feature-image-1.jpg)

 In place of Live Tiles, you’ve got a **Pinned apps** section where you can pin apps for faster access. You can hit the **All apps** button to see all the apps that you’ve installed on your PC.

 Another change in Windows 11’s Start Menu is the new **Recommended** section where the OS displays the most used apps and files. You can disable the Recommended section from inside the **Settings** app if you don’t like it.

 Finally, just like Windows 10, Windows 11 retains the Start Menu’s search function. The only difference is that the search bar is now located on top of the menu rather than at the bottom.

## Windows 11 Features an Enhanced Widgets Panel

![Windows 11 widgets pane](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/top-windows-11-features-8.jpg)

 The Widgets panel in Windows 11 works just like the Windows 10 version, but with some added functionalities and a new design. In this panel, some tiles show you news, weather information, a calendar, to-do lists, and sports results. You can customize the layout to some extent by adding and removing widgets.

 In short, the Widgets panel displays much more information than Windows 10’s News and Interests feature. Also, it is way nicer to look at.

## Windows 11 Uses Snap Layouts

 Windows 10 allows you to snap apps in place by dragging them to the edge of the screen. But you have to do the snapping and the resizing of the app windows manually. Windows 11 simplifies the process through [Snap Layouts](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-snap-layouts-in-windows-11/).

 In Windows 11, if you hover your mouse over the minimize/maximize button, a menu showing the different Snap Layouts pops up. For instance, from the menu, you can choose to open two apps side-by-side by clicking on the relevant layout. Once you've chosen the layout, you can choose the apps to populate the layout.

 The Widgets panel in Windows 11 works just like the Windows 10 version, but with some added functionalities and a new design. In this panel, some tiles show you news, weather information, a calendar, to-do lists, and sports results. You can customize the layout to some extent by adding and removing widgets.

 In short, the Widgets panel displays much more information than Windows 10’s News and Interests feature. Also, it is way nicer to look at.

## Windows 11 Uses Snap Layouts

 Windows 10 allows you to snap apps in place by dragging them to the edge of the screen. But you have to do the snapping and the resizing of the app windows manually. Windows 11 simplifies the process through [Snap Layouts](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-snap-layouts-in-windows-11/).

And while it may be tempting to stick with Windows 10, its fast-approaching end-of-support date plus the plethora of tools available for Windows 11 makes the migration more tempting than ever.

 Windows 11 is Microsoft’s most recent Windows release, and with it comes a lot of promises and changes from Microsoft. From a fresh, modern look to brand-new features, Windows 11 is quite a bit different than Windows 10\.

 While most of these differences are cosmetic, there are some notable changes that Microsoft has implemented in its new OS.

 Let’s take a look at the biggest differences between Windows 10 and Windows 11\.

## Windows 11 Has a Centered Taskbar

 When you first boot up Windows 11, the first thing you'll notice is the centered taskbar. Compared to the left-oriented taskbar of Windows 10, the taskbar in Windows 11 looks more like something from macOS.

 Aside from the positional changes, the Windows 11 taskbar has lost and gained a couple of major features. For instance, you can’t make it taller. Also, unlike Windows 10, you can’t move the taskbar around the screen.

 Moreover, you also lose the ability to make the taskbar icons smaller in Windows 11, something you could do in Windows 10\. However, if you want the Start button to be on the left side, you can [personalize the Windows 11 taskbar](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-personalize-taskbar/) to move the button to where it is on Windows 10\.

 That said, Microsoft has tried to give the taskbar a significant touchup. There are new animations for launching, minimizing, and maximizing apps. There are also new icons for **Search**, **Start Menu**, **Widgets**, and **Chat**.

## Windows 11 Has a Very Different Start Menu

 Perhaps the most controversial change, the Start Menu from Windows 10 is gone, and Microsoft has replaced it with a centered, stripped-down version without Live Tiles on Windows 11\.

 Live Tiles are a big part of the Windows 10 Start Menu. When Microsoft removed them from Windows 11, the company got a vocal response from both sides of the camp. People who loved Live Tiles’ ability to deliver information at a glance, lamented their loss. On the other hand, people who never used them praised their removal.

 In place of Live Tiles, you’ve got a **Pinned apps** section where you can pin apps for faster access. You can hit the **All apps** button to see all the apps that you’ve installed on your PC.

 Another change in Windows 11’s Start Menu is the new **Recommended** section where the OS displays the most used apps and files. You can disable the Recommended section from inside the **Settings** app if you don’t like it.

 Finally, just like Windows 10, Windows 11 retains the Start Menu’s search function. The only difference is that the search bar is now located on top of the menu rather than at the bottom.
