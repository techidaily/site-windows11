 As more productivity apps are released, accessing programs on your Windows 11 PC can be challenging. Especially if your work revolves around multitasking, accessing and switching between apps fast is crucial.

 This article will cover tips to make Windows 11 apps more accessible, so you can navigate around your digital workspace with minimal effort and little time.

## 1\. Get Rid of Unnecessary Programs and Bloatware

![List of installed apps on Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/list-of-installed-apps-on-windows-11.jpg)

 To make Windows apps easier to locate, it is sensible to first get rid of unnecessary software and [remove bloatware from your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-quickly-remove-bloatware-from-windows-11/). This will make searching for apps easier, and it will benefit your memory usage.

 To view a complete list of all apps and programs installed on your machine, hit **Windows + I** to open the settings page. Click **Apps**, then select **Installed Apps**. Now, you can view an alphabetical list of installed apps on your device. To remove an app, hit the three dots beside any app and select **Uninstall**.

 To change the list order, you can use the **Sort By** feature beneath the search bar. Apps can be sorted by their name, size, or by their installation date. If you have multiple drives, you can also filter results based on which drives apps are located in.

 Here’s how you can pin an app to the taskbar:

1. Navigate to the Windows search bar and type the name of the app.

 As a further benefit, some programs offer additional quick access options that you can view by right-clicking on them. The options include shortcuts to common in-app features. You can also open any app on the taskbar by holding the **Windows** key, followed by the number representing the app's position on the taskbar. For instance, **Windows + 3** will open the third item on the taskbar.

## 3\. Create Desktop Shortcuts

![Desktop Shortcuts on Windows 11 Desktop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/desktop-shortcuts-on-windows-11-desktop.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Creating desktop shortcuts is one of the fastest ways to access apps with minimal effort. Before starting, you’ll first want to [declutter your Windows 11 Desktop](https://www.makeuseof.com/revamp-windows-11-desktop/) to create a clean environment for your apps.

 To pin an app to the desktop, hit the **Windows** button to open the Start menu, then select **All apps** button located in the corner of the Pinned section. Scroll through the alphabetical list to find the app, then click and drag it to any available space on your desktop. If done correctly, a small pop-up titled **Link** should display.

## 4\. Use the Run Dialog

![Run Dialogue on Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/run-dialogue-on-windows-11.jpg)

 Not all apps are easy to find, especially if you’re a developer. The Run dialogue is a powerful tool to locate programs that are harder to find on your Windows 11 device.

 To open the Run dialogue, use the shortcut **Windows + R**. In the search box, you can type the executable file name of any app to open it. Some basic commands include typing “calc” to open the calculator app, “notepad” to open Windows 11’s Notepad, and “control” to open the Control Panel. View our [Run commands cheat sheet](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-run-commands-cheat-sheet/) for a full list of handy shortcuts.

![oranage and black mechanical keyboard on table](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/oranage-and-black-mechanical-keyboard-on-table.jpg)

 One of the less-known methods to open Windows apps quicker is by creating custom keyboard shortcuts. By using these shortcuts, you can open a program instantly from any location.

 You can assign a keyboard shortcut to any Windows app by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the search bar and type the name of the app.
2. Right-click the app and select **Open File Location**.

## 6\. Utilize the Quick Access Menu

 The Quick Access menu is a list of common programs and tools. This is not to be confused with the Quick Access feature seen in Windows File Explorer. However, the two features achieve similar goals.

 You can open the Quick Access menu in two ways:

* Use the keyboard shortcut **Windows + X**.
* Right-click on the Start button on the taskbar.

 You can use the Quick Access menu to [access the task manager on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-access-task-manager-on-windows-11/) and open a bunch of other frequently used apps. There are also some useful extra tools you can access via the Quick Access menu. You can hit the **Desktop** option to minimize all apps. You’ll also find power options, including **Sleep** and **Shut Down**.

 For even faster access, you can hit the underlined letter on your keyboard to open that program. (Note, this only works when using the keyboard shortcut method to open the Quick Access Menu). The Quick Access menu is a great way to access a wide range of useful apps with only the keyboard.

## 7\. Switch Between Apps Faster

 If you’re dealing with an overflow of open windows and need a better way to transition between apps, you’ll find this next tip helpful.

 The keyboard shortcut **Alt + Tab** can be used to switch windows in your workspace. To navigate to another app, simply hold **Alt** and keep tapping **Tab** until you reach the desired app. If you prefer the older retro look of the **Alt** \+ **Tab** switcher, you can hit the right **Alt** key before pressing **Tab** to navigate the old-fashioned way.

 The **Task View** on Windows 11 is another method to access programs quicker and keep your apps organized. This allows you to [create virtual desktops](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-create-virtual-desktops-in-windows-11/) and categorize open apps and windows.

 To enter Task View, use the keyboard shortcut **Windows +** **Tab** or hit the dedicated button beside the search bar. Now you can move apps between virtual desktops by clicking and dragging them. This will reduce overwhelm and help you [multitask better on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-multitasking-tips/).
