## Quick Steps to Resolve Steam's Internet Connectivity

 No matter if you‚Äôre a casual or hardcore gamer, chances are Steam is your go-to platform for buying and playing titles. Despite its popularity, you might run into the ‚ÄúNo Internet Connection‚Äù error while using Steam on a Windows computer.

 Fixing this Steam error might be a bit challenging as you don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs something wrong with your internet connection, the Steam client, or your system settings. Fortunately, you can fix the issue by going through the instruction below.

## 1\. Go Online on Steam

 Steam‚Äôs Offline Mode allows you to[play Steam games without connecting to the internet](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-steam-offline-mode/) . This feature is helpful if you don‚Äôt want to install updates for single-player games or you're traveling without reliable internet.

 But if you need Steam to connect to the internet, you must disable Offline Mode. Launch the Steam app and open the**Steam** menu from the top-left corner. There, select the**Go Online** option. Then, click**Leave Offline Mode** to confirm the action.

 If it‚Äôs been a while since you‚Äôve gone online, you might have to wait for Steam to install missing updates before launching your games.

## 2\. Update Steam

 Most of the time, Steam automatically downloads and installs new updates. But there‚Äôs a chance something went wrong during the last update, and you‚Äôre now running an outdated version. This may cause Steam from working properly and cause its inability to connect to the internet.

 In this case, you should manually search for Steam updates. Launch the app and click**Steam > Check for Steam Client Updates** .

![Check for Steam updates.](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/check-updates-steam-1.jpg)

 Once Steam installs any pending updates, restart the app and check if the problem is now fixed. If Steam shows the**Your Steam client is already up-to-date** message, you are already running the latest version. In this case, move on to the next solution.

## 3\. Run Steam With Administrative Rights

 While this may seem odd, Steam sometimes required elevated privileges to connect to the internet. To test it, right-click the Steam app and select**Run as administrator** . If you no longer get the ‚ÄúNo Internet Connection‚Äù error while running Steam with administrative privileges, you should[make Steam always run as Administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/always-run-apps-administrator-windows/) .

## 4\. Verify Your Network Connection

 Before going on to more complex solutions, check if you‚Äôre having a working internet connection. If Steam isn‚Äôt the only one that has trouble connecting to the internet, you should check your Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection.

 If you‚Äôre[connected to the Wi-Fi but have no internet](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/no-internet-access-fix-windows/) , you‚Äôll have to fix it, so Steam can establish a reliable connection.

## 5\. Check Steam Servers

 There‚Äôs a chance there‚Äôs nothing wrong on your end, and you get the ‚ÄúNo Internet Connection‚Äù error because the servers are down. You can go to websites such as[Downdetector](https://downdetector.com/) and check if other users have reported problems as well.

![Check Steam servers](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/steam-downdetector-1.jpg)

 If there‚Äôs an issue with Steam servers, there‚Äôs nothing you can do except wait for the problem to be resolved.

## 6\. Run the Network Troubleshooter

 Network issues are some of the most annoying. Usually, it‚Äôs quite difficult to pinpoint the exact cause, and you might have to try multiple fixes until you fix the problem. However, before resetting your network or trying other complex solutions, give Windows a chance to fix the problem for you.

![Run network troubleshooter in Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/network-troubleshooter-1.jpg)

 Press**Windows key + I** to launch Windows Settings and go to**System > Troubleshoot** . There, click the**Run** button next to**Network Adapter** . Windows will look for any problems and suggest fixes for you to try.

## 7\. Allow Steam Through Windows Firewall

 The Windows Firewall is designed to protect your computer from network-based threats. While Steam isn‚Äôt a threat to your system security, the firewall may see it as one.

 In this case, you could try turning off the Windows Firewall and check if Steam still shows the internet connection error. However, connecting to a network without an active firewall or antivirus may put you at risk. So, we recommend you[allow Steam through Windows Firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/) .

## 8\. Turn Off the VPN Connection

 Steam might have trouble connecting to the internet if you‚Äôve set up a VPN connection. You could try turning off the VPN and launching Steam again.

 If you no longer face the same error, you‚Äôll have to switch off your VPN connection every time you want to launch Steam. Alternatively, you could search for a VPN service provider that will not interfere with Steam functionality.

 The same goes if you‚Äôve installed a third-party antivirus. You should take a look at its exception list and add Steam or switch to a different antivirus.

## 9\. Restart Your Router

 If running the network troubleshooter didn‚Äôt fix the connection issue, you should restart your router. By doing so, you give it a chance to clear out stored data which might fix your Steam connection issues.

 If turning your router off and on again isn‚Äôt enough to fix the problem, you should check our guide on how to[reboot your router the correct way](https://www.makeuseof.com/reboot-router-correct-way/) .

## 10\. Reset Network Settings

 Steam will encounter difficulties while trying to connect to the internet if there‚Äôs something wrong with your network settings. In this case, you should[reset your network settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/reset-network-settings-windows-11/) .

 By doing so, Windows will remove all Wi-Fi connections, so make sure you know the network password before reverting the network settings to their default values.

## 11\. Reinstall the Steam App

 If you‚Äôre out of solutions and Steam is still showing the ‚ÄúNo Internet Connection‚Äù error, it‚Äôs time to reinstall Steam. Even if you‚Äôre in the middle of a game's campaign, there‚Äôs no need to worry as reinstalling Steam will not delete any game progress.

 First, launch Windows Settings and go to**Apps > Installed Apps** . There, click the**three-dot** icon next to**Steam** and select**Uninstall** .

![Uninstall Steam on Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/uninstall-steam-1.jpg)

 Once the process is complete, head to[Steam's website](https://store.steampowered.com/) and download the app.

## Get Steam Back Online

 By going through the above fixes, you should get rid of the ‚ÄúNo Internet Connection‚Äù error. But if the Steam servers are temporarily down, there‚Äôs nothing you can do except wait.

 Once the problem is solved, you can decide which game you should play next using Steam Interactive Recommender.
