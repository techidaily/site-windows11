## Precision in File Ordering with These Tools

 Whether you are a professional photographer or hobbyist, if your storage devices are full of new and old photos scattered all over, you probably want to organize them as well. It is imperative for professional photographers to have their work organized and be able to find the photos in a jiffy.

 A Photo organizer software can help you and your teams organize photos on your computer. It organizes images into sub-folders based on the date-taken, and camera mode and supports metadata editing. More premium apps use Artificial Intelligence to help you automatically add useful metadata and group photos with the same faces.

 Here we look at the best photos organizer apps for Windows to organize and preserve your photos for today and the future.

## 1\. Excire Foto

![Excire_Foto windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/excire_foto-windows.jpg)

 Excire Foto is an impressive photo management utility, mainly because of its AI integration. It features a cleaner user interface with plenty of advanced features to fiddle around.

 You can start by adding the picture folders to the Excire Foto database. It will import the images and analyze photos to extract the metadata. This is where the magic happens. AI integration will automatically identify the objects in the image and add relevant keywords. This saves you from the hassle of labeling your images manually, though it is possible.

 Furthermore, you can add colored labels to show progress, add ratings and flags and move them to custom collections or groups. You can search your collection by keywords or use Find Faces with custom filters.

 Excire Foto doesn't have many issues, except that it lacks any image editing tools. But as a photo management utility, it excels with its AI tools that do most of your organizing job for you!

 Photo Organizer is a photo organizing and management utility that lets you find scattered images on your system and organize them at a single location.

 Photo Organize is different than other organizers in this list. Instead of simply locating the images, it lets you move all the photos to a single location. It features an impressive import function that can find scattered images, search old backups, skip duplicate files, and import them all to one location.

 It will automatically organize the photos in sub-folders based on the date taken, camera mode, etc. You can also batch rename files, view files in the preview, and add them to your favorites.

 On the flip side, importing images can feel slower. This concerns the fact that the app copies or moves the scattered images to a central location for easier management. It also doesn’t allow you to color label or rate photos.

## 6\. Magix Photo Manager Deluxe

![magix photo manager deluxe](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/magix-photo-manager-deluxe.jpg)

 Magix Photo Manager Deluxe is a combination of photo management and presentation utility. You can use it for basic photo management tasks with a handful of utilities to import, organize, optimize, archive, present, and create slide shows.

 Start by selecting the image folder to import. Next, head over to the Tasks tab. It consists of image search functionality, basic editing tools to optimize images and videos, and a presentation feature to show the folder as a slideshow. You can also organize photos by stars, labels, and people, create custom albums and burn the photos to a DVD/CD.

 While it features a facial recognition feature, it feels like a labor-intensive task as you have to manually input a person’s facial feature and assign a name before the app can start recognizing the face.
