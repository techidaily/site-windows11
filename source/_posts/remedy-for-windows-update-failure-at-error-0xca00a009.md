## Remedy for Windows Update Failure at Error 0xCA00A009

 The Windows Update Service is a built-in application responsible for managing the installation of Windows updates. Microsoft uses this service to release Windows updates and security patches. However, in some cases, Windows Updates may not work as they should and instead return an error message with a code, and one such error code is 0xCA00A009.

 You may encounter this problem if you have upgraded Windows to the latest version. This article will guide you through some troubleshooting steps for getting Windows updates working again.

## What Causes Windows Update Error 0xCA00A009

 There are many factors that cause Windows Update errors, but the most common are corrupted or faulty system files. This problem can also occur if you upgrade from an older version of Windows 11.

 Other possible causes that may result in this error code are listed below.

1. Corrupted system files or data in the SoftwareDistribution folder could result in this problem.
2. If you upgrade your OS from an older Windows version to Windows 11.
3. A startup program or service that conflicts with Windows Update may also cause it.

Let's now move on to solutions.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 If you're having problems updating Windows, and you're getting the error 0xCA00A009, it's likely that there is a file that is damaged or missing that Windows Update requires to function.

Here are the steps to take:

1. Click the**Start** button, then click the power icon.

Your computer will restart and hopefully fix the 0xCA00A009 error.

1. Run Command Prompt as an administrator. To do this, search for "Command Prompt" and select**Run as administrator** .
2. Type the below command line and press Enter:

## 5\. Clear the SoftwareDistribution Folder

 Software Distribution stores temporary files that may be required to run Windows Updates. And when these files become corrupted, these types of errors may occur. In this case, you can clear the contents of the folder and see if it works.

To clear the SoftwareDistribution folder, follow these steps:

1. Open Command Prompt with Administrative Privileges.
2. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt and hit Enter after each one:  
`net stop wuauserv  
net stop bits  
net stop cryptSvc  
net stop msiserver`
3. After executing the above commands,[open Windows File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and browse to "C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution\\."
4. Inside the SoftwareDistribution folder, press**Ctrl + A** to select all the contents and tap Delete on your keyboard.
5. If you are asked to grant permission via a pop-up menu, click on**Continue** to proceed.
6. When you have deleted the contents of the SoftwareDistribution folder, you will need to restart any services that were stopped earlier. To accomplish this, open the elevated command prompt again and run the following command:  
`net start wuauserv  
net start bits  
net start cryptSvc  
net start msiserver`
7. Now type exit and press Enter to close the Command Prompt window.

 When you have completed all of the above steps, restart your computer and try updating Windows again after you've completed all the steps.

## 6\. Perform a Clean Boot

 This problem may also occur when a startup program or service conflicts with Windows Update. In this case, you should perform a clean boot as explained below:

1. Open the Run dialog box.
2. Type "msconfig" in the text field and click**OK** to open the System Configuration window.
3. In the System Configuration window, select the**General** tab.
4. Check the box next to**Selective startup** .
5. Uncheck the**Load startup items** box.  
![Perform-a-Clean-Boot-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Perform-a-Clean-Boot-1.jpg)
6. Switch to the**Services** tab now.
7. Select**Hide all Microsoft services** , then click**Disable all** .  
![Hide all Microsoft services](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hide-all-Microsoft-services.jpg)
8. Click**Apply** to save the changes.
9. Go to the**Startup** tab and select**Open Task Manager** . This will take you to the Startup tab in Task Manager.
10. Right-click each service on the**Startup** tab, and disable them.
11. Click**OK** when you're done editing System Configuration.

 Be sure to restart your computer after completing the above steps and follow up with updating Windows. If you find that this method solves your problem, you must have disabled the wrong service. To figure out which service is causing the error, enable them one by one.
