## Unveiling the Superiority: Win11 vs MacOS Facts

 Whether Windows is better than macOS has long been a serious bone of contention between tech enthusiasts. And the debate is still ongoing, with people comparing Windows 11 to the latest macOS versions.

 In this article, we are putting together a list of tasks that Windows 11 handles way better than macOS.

## 1\. Windows 11 Offers Better Multitasking Than macOS

 Windows 11 has a "Snap layouts" feature to assist you in aligning multiple app windows by providing multiple layout options. Depending on the screen size, Windows 11 allows you to choose between up to six different layouts for aligning the windows. However, on macOS, you can only view two apps side by side. Also, it requires more effort to position two apps side by side on macOS than in Windows 11.

 On macOS, you can drag one window to the right and the other to the left. If you want to see more than two active windows, you can do by resizing them. Some third-party apps can make snapping on macOS a bit easier, but most are paid.

 On the other hand, you can install PowerToys on Windows 11 to get advanced multitasking features and go beyond six layout options absolutely for free. You can learn[how to use PowerToys to do more on Windows 10 and 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-powertoys/) .

## 2\. The Taskbar in Windows 11 Is Better Than the macOS Dock Experience

 The taskbar in Windows 11 is better than the macOS Dock experience in many ways. For example, the taskbar is highly customizable as compared to the Dock. You can change its color, transparency levels, and alignment of app icons in it.

 Also, unless the taskbar is stuffed with too many app icons, you have useful empty spaces where you can click to go directly to Task Manager and Taskbar settings. You can do none of that in macOS.

 Moreover, you can get a thumbnail preview of apps opened by hovering your mouse over the app icon in the taskbar. The preview also gives you useful control options. For example, the thumbnail preview of the music player app will include options like Play, Pause, and Skip. A preview of apps is not supported in the macOS Dock.

## 3\. Windows 11 Has Better App Support

 Windows is the most popular desktop operating system, and this is why most app developers bring their apps to the OS first. As a result, Windows 11 reaps the benefits of a large library of Windows programs. Thanks to better app support, you can even change the look and feel of Windows 11 and do so much more.

 If you switch from Windows to macOS, you may also end up paying for some of the apps you have been using for free on Microsoft's desktop OS. This can be a deal breaker for many people.

## 4\. Windows 11 Can Run Android Apps

 You can use many Android apps on your Windows 11 PC via the Amazon Appstore. However, this way, you can not access every Android app available on Google Play Store.

 On the other hand, if you have a premium or mid-range Samsung Galaxy Android phone, you can run your phone's Android apps on your Windows 11 PC via the Phone Link software. Long story short, you can run Android apps in Windows 11 comfortably if you meet the said criteria.

 You can not run Android apps on a Mac, nor can you run iOS apps on Windows 11\. iPhone devices and Windows 11 can not work as closely together as Android and Windows 11 do because Apple gives controlled access to its software and services to third parties.

## 5\. Windows 11 Can Connect to Both Android And iOS

 Windows 11 users can connect their iOS devices via the Phone Link for iPhone. By syncing your iPhone with Windows 11, you can see mobile notifications, keep yourself updated with the latest messages, and take or make phone calls right from your PC. You can do all of that if you have an Android phone.

 However, some extra privileges are there if you have a supported Samsung Galaxy phone. For example, you can access your mobile apps on your PC. Not only that, but Samsung Galaxy users will also be able to pin their phone apps to the Windows 11 taskbar. macOS can only connect with iPhones and not Android. We have a[definitive Windows Phone Link guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-phone-link-guide/) to help you connect your Android phone to Windows 11.

## 6\. Windows 11 Clipboard History Keeps a Record of the Last 25 Items You've Cut Or Copied

![Screenshot showing macOS clipboard history](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/screenshot-2023-04-11-at-2-28-23-pm.png)

 When you copy something on macOS, the clipboard history stores it. But macOS clipboard history isn't nearly as functional as the one in Windows 11.

 The clipboard history in Windows 11 will store copied text and images for later use. It will display the last 25 items you have cut or copied. When you are reading something and want to copy important lines, you can do so in one go instead of keep coming back to the article to copy and then paste wherever required. macOS clipboard will only display the last text item you copied.

 You can access the clipboard history in Windows 11 by pressing**Win + V** on your keyboard. As a reminder, the functionality is not enabled by default, but you can[enable the clipboard history on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-turn-on-clipboard-history/) by following a few simple steps.

## Other Advantages of Using Windows 11 Over macOS

 While Windows 11 has strict hardware requirements, it can still be run on a wide range of devices with different specifications. You can buy a Windows 11 PC at a dirt cheap price or spend a hefty price to buy a premium quality PC with powerful specifications. Also, Windows is the best desktop operating system for PC gaming. You can check out[why Windows is the best operating system for gaming](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-mac-linux-best-os-for-gaming/) .

## Windows 11 Outweighs macOS in Many Ways... but Choose Wisely

 Windows 11 outweighs macOS in every feature discussed above. However, all those benefits might not be of much use to you, depending on what you will do. If possible, try to use both operating systems to find out what suits your need and which one you love the most.
