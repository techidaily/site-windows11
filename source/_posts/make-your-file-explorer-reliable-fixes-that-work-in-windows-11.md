## Make Your File Explorer Reliable: Fixes That Work in Windows 11

 File Explorer is an essential app that allows you to access, manage, and organize files and folders on your computer. However, it’s not the most stable offering from Microsoft. There may be instances where File Explorer becomes unresponsive or, even worse, crashes on your Windows 11 computer.

 Frequent File Explorer crashes can disrupt your workflow and leave you frustrated. This post will discuss some useful tips to fix File Explorer crashes in Windows 11.

## 1\. Restart the Windows Explorer Process

 Windows Explorer is a system process that provides the graphical interface for several utilities like File Explorer, taskbar, Start menu, and more. Temporary issues with the Windows Explorer process can sometimes cause File Explorer to close unexpectedly on Windows. Instead of rebooting the system entirely, you can simply restart the Windows Explorer process to fix issues with it. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Right-click on the**Start icon** and select**Task Manager** from the list.
2. In the**Processes** tab, locate**Windows Explorer** . Right-click on it and select**Restart** .  
![Restart Windows Explorer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Restart-Windows-Explorer.jpg)

 Your taskbar will disappear for a split second before reappearing, indicating the Windows Explorer process has rebooted. After that, File Explorer should work fine on Windows.

## 2\. Clear File Explorer Cache

 File Explorer, like any other program, accumulates cache data to improve its performance. However, when this data becomes outdated or corrupt, it can lead to a variety of issues, including the one discussed here. You can try getting rid of the existing File Explorer cache to see if that helps. To do so, use these steps:

1. Open the**Start menu** , search for**file explorer options** , and select the first result that appears.
2. Under the**General** tab, click the**Clear** button next to**Clear File Explorer history** .

## 3\. Configure File Explorer Options

[Issues with Quick Access in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-fix-quick-access-not-showing-recent-files/) can also cause File Explorer to malfunction at times. If that's the case, you can configure File Explorer to open on This PC page to resolve the issue. Here are the steps you can follow.

1. Press**Win + E** to open File Explorer.
2. Click the**three-dot menu** icon at the top and select**Options** .
3. In the**Folder Options** window, click the drop down menu next to**Open File Explorer to** and select**This PC** .
4. Hit**Apply** followed by**OK** .

## 4\. Disable Your Antivirus Program

 It’s always a good idea to protect your system with an antivirus program. However, not all antivirus programs are equally reliable. It’s possible that your third-party antivirus program is conflicting with File Explorer processes, resulting in abrupt crashes. To check for this possibility, you can temporarily disable your antivirus program by clicking its icon on the taskbar and selecting**Disable > Disable until the next restart** .

## 5\. Launch Folder Windows in a Separate Process

 By default, all instances of File Explorer operate within a single explorer.exe process. As a result, when one of the File Explorer windows experiences issues, it affects all the active windows. To avoid this, you can configure Windows to open each File Explorer window in a separate process. Here's how to do it.

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run command dialog box.
2. Type**control.exe folders** in the text field and press**Enter** to open File Explore Options.
3. Switch to the**View** tab.
4. Under**Advanced settings** , tick the**Launch folder windows in a separate process** checkbox.
5. Hit**Apply** followed by**OK** .

## 6\. Run the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool

 You are likely to experience such File Explorer crashes if there is an issue with your PC’s RAM. Fortunately, Windows includes a useful Memory Diagnostic tool that can examine your RAM for any potential errors. Running the tool requires a system restart, so be sure to save all your work beforehand.

 Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog box. Type**mdsched** in the box and press**Enter** . Click**Restart now and check for problems** in the Windows Memory Diagnostic window.

![Run Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/run-windows-memory-diagnostic-tool.jpg)

 Wait for the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool to scan your PC's RAM for errors. If it discovers any issues, take appropriate steps to troubleshoot those problems.

## 7\. Troubleshoot in Clean Boot Mode

 When you boot Windows in a clean boot state, it only runs essential programs and processes. This can help you determine if the File Explorer crashes are caused by a faulty third-party app or program.

 We have a detailed guide on[how to perform a clean boot on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) . Follow the steps outlined there to enter clean boot mode. If File Explorer functions correctly while in this state, it means the background app or program causing the issue got disabled. You can consider removing any recently installed apps or programs to resolve the issue for good.

## 8\. Apply Some Generic Fixes to Fix File Explorer Crashes

 If the above fixes don’t work or if you experience similar issues with other programs, you can try out some of the generic solutions to fix issues with Windows. Let's go over all of them one by one.

* **Run an SFC Scan:** [Performing an SFC (or System File Checker) scan](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) will allow Windows to examine your PC for corrupt or damaged system files and repair them.
* **Scan for Malware:** The presence of malware or viruses can cause File Explorer to misbehave on Windows. You can[use Microsoft Defender’s offline scan to detect and remove malware](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-remove-malware-using-microsoft-defenders-offline-scan/) from your PC.
* **Clear Temporary Files:** Having an excessive number of temporary files on your PC can have a negative impact on your system's performance. Hence, it’s a good idea to[delete temporary files in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-delete-temporary-files/) .
* **Install Windows Updates:** Such issues can also occur due to a buggy or outdated Windows build. You can try[installing all the pending Windows updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-install-updates/) and see if that solves your problem.
