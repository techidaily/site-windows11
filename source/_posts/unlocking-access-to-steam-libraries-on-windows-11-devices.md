## Unlocking Access to Steam Libraries on Windows 11 Devices

 While Steam is without any issues for many, some users face the “Steam library folder not writable” error when they try to install a game using the Steam client. The error also appears while installing an update for the app.

 If you face the same predicament, don’t fret. Let's explore multiple methods to resolve this annoying error code and help you successfully install your games on Steam again.

 If you are unable to install the game on the C drive, you must add another drive in the Steam Storage settings. Then, attempt the game installation in the newly added drive. Here’s how to do it:

2. Click on the **Settings** option.
3. Scroll down and click on the **Storage** option.

5. Now, click on the **Add** button.

## 9\. Format the Disk and Try Again

 Many users want to install games on a newly added disk drive but face the “Steam library folder not writable” error in the process. It is mainly because the newly added disk drive bears the same letter as the old drive with a Steam Library folder.
