## 3 Ways to Adjust the Mouse Double-Click Speed on Windows

 Is the default Windows mouse double-click speed too fast or quite slow for you? In this article, we’ll check out how you can adjust the mouse double-click speed to your liking.

 But first, we’ll take a look at the difference between single, double, and triple mouse clicks.

## What Is the Difference Between Single, Double, and Triple Mouse Clicks?

![An illustration of questions and answers](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/An-illustration-of-questions-and-answers.jpg)

 By default, the left mouse button allows you to perform various actions, such as opening files and highlighting text. Meanwhile, the right mouse button usually helps with opening up context menus.

 Interestingly, you can configure some settings to swap the functionalities of the left and right mouse buttons. But in this article, we'll focus on the default mouse settings.

 Now, let’s explore the difference between the clicks you can perform with the left mouse button.

### Single Click

 You’d usually single-click when you want to select a button, an object, or the contents of a menu.

 For example, if you’ve got a couple of active browser tabs, you can access one of them by single-clicking on it. Also, you can close a browser window by single-clicking on the close button that appears on it.

### Double Click

![Person using a computer mouse](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/person-using-a-computer-mouse.jpg)

 You’d usually double-click when you want to open a file.

 For example, let’s say you’ve just accessed a folder containing your pictures. If you want to quickly open one of the images within the folder, you can simply double-click on it.

 But you don’t always have to double-click on a program to open it. For example, you can open an item on the taskbar by single-clicking on it. And if you’re unsure if a single or double-click is required, always try single-clicking first.

 Double-clicking can also help when you're typing or reading. For example, you can quickly highlight or select a specific word within a paragraph by double-clicking on it.

### Triple Click

 Triple-clicking usually comes in handy when you’re typing or reading. For example, if you want to quickly highlight an entire paragraph, then you can simply triple-click on it.

 Now, let’s check out how you can adjust the mouse double-click speed to your liking.

## 1\. Adjust the Mouse Double-Click Speed Using the System Settings

![Selecting the DoubleClickSpeed option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/selecting-the-doubleclickspeed-option.jpg)

 Enter a value between **0** and **900** in the **Value data** box. In this case, **0** is the slowest mouse double-click speed, while **900** is the fastest.

 Finally, click the **OK** button and close the Registry Editor.
