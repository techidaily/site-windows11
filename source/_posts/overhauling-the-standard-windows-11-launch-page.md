## Overhauling the Standard Windows 11 Launch Page

### Key Takeaways

* You can remove the Home page from the Settings app in Windows 11 using the Group Policy Editor or the Registry Editor.
* The Group Policy Editor is only available in certain editions of Windows, but there are workarounds for enabling it in the Home edition.
* It's important to back up registry files or create a restore point before making changes, as incorrect modifications can cause serious issues.
