### Key Takeaways

* If you cannot switch out of Windows S Mode, it may be due to issues with Microsoft servers.
* Restart the wauserv service in the Task Manager to fix any glitches with the Microsoft Update service, which handles update-related tasks on your PC.
* Try signing out of the Microsoft Store and signing back in before attempting to exit Windows S Mode again.

 Windows S Mode is a restricted version of Windows 11 and 10 where you can only install apps from the Microsoft Store, cannot access the Registry or the Group Policy Editor, and are stuck with Edge and Bing as the default browser and search engine. To install an app unavailable in the Microsoft Store, you must get out of Windows S Mode and upgrade. But sometimes, you can't switch out of the S mode because of an error.

 Try these fixes to get out of the Windows S mode for good.

So, check the official [Microsoft Service status](https://admin.microsoft.com/servicestatus) website or Microsoft Store's [X page](https://twitter.com/MicrosoftStore) for outage reports.

 You can also check out third-party websites like [Down Detector](https://downdetector.com/). In such a case, patiently wait while Microsoft fixes the issue.

## 7\. Reset the Microsoft Store

 The Microsoft Store app can stop working correctly due to corrupt cache files. So, you must [reset the Microsoft Store via Settings or the Terminal](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-11-reset-microsoft-store/).

## 8\. Re-register All System Apps

 If resetting the Microsoft Store doesn’t resolve the issue, you must re-register all system apps, including the Microsoft Store. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open the [PowerShell as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-powershell-administrator/).
2. Type the following command and press **Enter** to execute it:  
`Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "SystemApps"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}`

3. Closethe Command Prompt windows and restart your PC.

## 9\. Do an In-place Upgrade

 You can [do an In-place upgrade on your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/in-place-upgrade-windows-11/) to get out of the S mode. It is better than resetting your Windows PC because an In-place upgrade preserves all your files, apps, and data stored in the C drive.

## Get Rid of Windows S Mode

 It's not difficult to solve why you can't exit the S mode on your Windows PC. Check Microsoft services, update the Microsoft Store app, and sign out and sign in again. Then, rename the SoftwareDistribution folder, reset all system apps, and do an In-place Upgrade to fix the issue if everything fails.
