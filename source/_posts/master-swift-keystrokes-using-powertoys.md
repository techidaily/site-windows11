5. Finally, click on the blue**OK** button on top and click on**Continue Anyway** on the warning prompt. Now when you type P on your keyboard, the letter S will get typed.

 Remapping a key is also handy if a key stops functioning. You can map it to another key till you get the faulty key fixed or buy a new keyboard.

 You can also map shortcuts like Ctrl + I to a key. Click on the**plus sign** under**Physical Key.** Then click on the**Type** button. Next, select a key like**F1** by pressing it on the keyboard. Then click**OK** .

 Now under the**Mapped to** section, click on the**Type** button. Now press**Ctrl + I** or the Italicize shortcut on the keyboard to map the**F1** key to it.

 Now, when you need to italicize a text, instead of Ctrl + I, just press a single key, F1\. So you'll automatically be typing faster.

 This way, you could remap many alphabet and number keys, and even function keys to speed up your work. Think of all the milliseconds and seconds you will save whenever you type.

### How to Remap Shortcuts to Type Faster

 Below the**Remap a key** option you'll find the**Remap a shortcut** option. Click on it to open**Remap shortcuts** window. You can remap common shortcuts to other shortcuts you prefer to use.

 For example, instead of pressing**Ctrl + B** keys to make a text bold, you'd rather use**Shift (left) + Z** —Shift (left) + Z keys are next to each other and easier and faster to press together. So in the**Remap Shortcuts** window, type**Shift (left) + Z** under**Physical Shortcut** and**Ctrl + B** under the**Mapped to** section.

 You can choose**All Apps** as the Target App or an app such as**Word** , where you want this remapped shortcut to work. But remember to put the executable name or**EXE name** of the Word app, which is**Winword** . You can easily find the EXE names of apps via a Google search.
