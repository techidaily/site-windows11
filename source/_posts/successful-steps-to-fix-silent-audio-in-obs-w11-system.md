 OBS Studio is a free-to-use app that allows you to record gameplay and stream online. However, like any other application, it has its own share of flaws. Many users have reported that OBS Studio fails to record audio on their Windows 11 PC.

 Luckily, it's a very common issue and can quickly be resolved. Here are all the working solutions that will help you fix OBS Studio if it is unable to record audio.

## 2\. Launch OBS Studio With Administrative Rights

 Oftentimes, issues in third-party applications occur due to a lack of administrative privileges. It can happen even when you're using an administrator account on your computer.

 The best way to resolve this problem is to configure OBS Studio to always launch as an administrator. To do that, follow the below steps:

1. Right-click on the OBS Studio icon and choose**Properties** from the context menu.
2. In the Properties window, switch to the**Compatibility** tab.
3. Check the**Run this program as an administrator** option.

5. Also, click the drop-down icon next to OBS Studio, then choose the correct input device.  
![Choosing default audio device for OBS Studio](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/choosing-default-audio-device.jpg)

Restart OBS Studio and check if the problem persists.

## 4\. Use the Correct Recording Device

 Windows allows you to manually choose recording and playback devices. But if you've chosen an incorrect recording device in Settings, then you're likely to face this issue. To fix this, you will have to configure the correct device as the default recording option. Here's how to do that:

1. Open the**Settings** app, and head towards**System** \>**Sound.**
2. Choose**More sound settings** under the**Advanced section.**
3. Switch to the**Recording** tab.
4. Right-click on the correct recording device and choose the**Set as Default Device** option from the context menu.  
![Set as default option in Sound properties](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/set-as-default-option.jpg)
5. Click**Apply** and then**OK.**

## 5\. Allow OBS Studio to Access Microphone

[Windows 11 is big on privacy and security](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-privacy-options-explained/) . The OS lets you allow or restrict apps from accessing certain services of your computer. For instance, you can restrict apps from using the microphone on your computer.

 As such, if you've mistakenly restricted OBS Studio from accessing the microphone, then you'll face audio issues. The solution here is to allow OBS Studio to access the microphone. Here's how:

1. Open the Settings app and choose**Privacy & Security** from the left sidebar.
2. Under the**App permission** section, select the**Microphone** option.
3. Enable the toggle next to the**Microphone access** option.  
![Microphone access option in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/microphone-access.jpg)
4. Next, enable the toggle next to**Let desktop apps to access your microphone** option.

## 6\. Change the OBS Studio Settings

 OBS Studio lets you manually set audio devices and adjust their settings as per your preference. However, OBS Studio will be unable to record audio if you have chosen an incorrect audio device within its settings.

 So, head toward the OBS Studio audio settings, and choose the correct audio device to solve the issue. Here are the steps to do it:

1. Launch OBS Studio and choose**File** from the top-left corner.
2. Choose**Settings** from the context menu.
3. In the Settings window, select**Audio** from the left sidebar.
4. Under the**Global Audio Devices** section, click the drop-down icon next to**Desktop Audio** and**Desktop Audio 2** and choose**Default** in both options.
5. Next, click the drop-down icon next to**Mic/Auxiliary Audio** and**Mic/Auxiliary Audio 2** and choose**Default** in both options.  
![Audio settings of OBS Studio](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/audio-settings.jpg)
6. Choose**Apply** \>**OK** to save the changes.

## 7 . Adjust the Audio Mixer Settings

 The next solution on the list is to adjust the audio mixer settings of the OBS Studio. Here's how:

1. Open OBS Studio.
2. Under the**Audio Mixer** section, adjust the**Mic/Aux** slider to**\-2.1dB.**  
![Adjusting dB in OBS Studio](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/adjusting-db.jpg)

![Choosing Advanced properties in OBS Studio](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/advanced-properties.jpg)

## 8\. Download the Latest Audio Driver Updates

 A corrupt or outdated audio driver can also be a prime reason why OBS Studio is unable to record audio. To fix this, you will have to[update the audio driver on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-audio-drivers-windows-11/) .

You can do that by following the below steps:

1. Press the**Win + X** hotkeys and choose**Device Manager** from the list.
2. Double-click the**Sound, video, and game controllers** node to expand it.
3. Right-click on your default recording device and select**Update driver** from the context menu.  
![Update driver option in Device Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/update-driver-2.jpg)
4. Choose**Search automatically for drivers** option in the window that crops up.

 Next, allow Windows to search for and download any available driver updates for your recording device.
