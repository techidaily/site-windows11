## Seamless Steps to Launch WordPad on Windows

 WordPad is a basic word-processing program that comes installed on most Windows PCs. The program allows you to create and edit documents, but it lacks some of the more advanced features of other word-editing applications. Despite its limited features, WordPad can be a helpful tool for quickly creating and editing simple documents.

 If you're new to Windows, you may not know how to open WordPad. Here are some quick and easy ways to launch WordPad on your Windows PC.

## 1\. How to Open WordPad Using the Windows Search Tool

 If you're not sure how to open WordPad on your Windows PC, don't worry! You can easily find and launch the program using the Windows Search tool.

To open WordPad using the search tool, follow these steps:

1. Head to the Start menu and search for "WordPad."

 Task Manager is a built-in application on Windows that provides users with information about the processes and programs running on their computers.

 The Task Manager has a "Run new task" feature that lets you run WordPad without having to go to the Windows Start menu. When the Start menu isn't working or if you want to launch a program with different settings than the default, this is an option you might find helpful.
