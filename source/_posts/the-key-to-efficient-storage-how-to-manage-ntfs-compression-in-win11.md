## The Key to Efficient Storage: How to Manage NTFS Compression in Win11

 Is your Windows computer running out of storage? There are plenty of ways to remove redundant data and free up some extra space. Among all, the most preferred method is using NTFS file compression.

 NTFS file compression is a Windows feature that compresses files and folders by removing reductant data from them. The best part about this feature is that it does its job without damaging the file and losing the data.

 Nevertheless, let's check out some ways to enable NTFS file compression in Windows 11.

## 1\. Enable NTFS File Compression Through the File Explorer

 The quickest way to enable NTFS[file compression](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-file-compression-guide/) is through File Explorer. Below are the steps to compress a folder:

1. Open the File Explorer and head toward the folder you want to compress.
2. Right-click on the target folder and choose**Properties** from the context menu.
3. In the**General** tab, select the**Advanced** option.
4. Under the**Compress or Encrypt attributes** section, check the**Compress contents to save disk space** box and click**OK** .

7. Click**OK.**

 That's it, the folder has now been compressed. You can confirm this by comparing the current folder size with its previous size.

 From now on, every file or folder that you will move inside the compressed folder will be compressed automatically. To disable compression, uncheck the**Compress contents to save disk space** box and save the changes.

Similarly, you can compress an entire drive. Here's how:

1. Open the File Explorer, and right-click on the drive you want to compress.
2. In the**General** tab, check the**Compress this drive to save disk space** box.

3. Click**Apply** and then click**OK** on the confirmation box that crops up.

## 2\. Enable NTFS File Compression Using the Command Prompt

1. Press the**Win + S** hotkeys to open the**Windows Search.**
