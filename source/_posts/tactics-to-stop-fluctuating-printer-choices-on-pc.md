## Tactics to Stop Fluctuating Printer Choices on PC

 Setting a default printer on Windows saves you the hassle of manually selecting your preferred printer device across various apps and programs. But what if the default printer keeps changing on your Windows 10 or 11 PC?

 Here are some tips that will keep the default printer from changing on your PC.

## 1\. Prevent Windows From Managing Your Default Printer

 If you have allowed Windows to manage your default printer, it may automatically change the printer depending on your current location. If you don't want that, use these steps to prevent Windows from changing the default printer.

1. Open the **Start menu** and click the **gear-shaped icon** to launch the Settings app.
2. Select **Bluetooth & devices** from the left sidebar.
3. Click on **Printers & scanners**.
4. Under the **Printer preferences** section, disable the toggle next to **Let Windows manage my default printer**.
5. Now select the printer you want to set as the default option.
6. Click the **Set as default** button at the top.

 After you complete the above steps, Windows should not change the default printer on its own.

## 2\. Edit the Relevant Registry Files

 If the default printer keeps changing even after you disable the **Let Windows manage my default printer** option, you will need to edit the registry files in order to fix the issue.

 Making incorrect changes to registry files can cause irreversible damage to your computer. Hence, it is important to follow the steps carefully and create a backup of all registry files before proceeding. If you need help with that, refer to our guide on how to [back up and restore the Windows registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/).

 Once you have done that, use these steps to edit the registry files:

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **registry editor** in the search box and select **Run as administrator**.
3. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. In the Registry Editor window, use the left pane to navigate to **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER > SOFTWARE > Microsoft > Windows NT > CurrentVersion > Windows**.
5. In the right pane, double-click the **LegacyDefaultPrinterMode** key to edit it.
6. Enter **1** in the **Value data** field and click **OK**.
