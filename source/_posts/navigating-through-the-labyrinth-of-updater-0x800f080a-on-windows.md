## What Causes Windows Update Error 0x800f080a?

 The most common cause of Windows Update Error 0x800f080a is an issue with the system file. If certain key system files become outdated or corrupted, it can prevent Windows from properly downloading and installing updates.

 Another possible cause could be an issue with the Windows Update components themselves. If these components are corrupted or disabled on your system, you may experience this error when trying to update your computer. In some cases, the error might also be triggered if there is a conflict between different third-party applications.

 Having read the above causes, perhaps you have a better understanding of what it is all about. Now let's figure out how to fix this issue.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 If you're experiencing error 0x800f080a while updating Windows, this indicates there's something wrong with Windows Updates, possibly due to a conflict between software or corrupted files. Restarting your computer gives it a chance to reset all its settings and processes, which can help resolve this error code quickly and easily.

 To restart your machine, you'll need to open the**Start Menu** on the bottom left-hand side of your screen, select**Power** from the pop-up menu, then click**Restart** . Once you've restarted, you should open Windows Update again and check if the issue has been resolved.

## 2\. Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter

 As soon as you have completed the steps above, restart your computer, and then try updating Windows again to see if it fixes the issue.

## 3\. Check Date & Time Settings

 A date and time setting error on your computer may also lead to Windows Update Error 0x800f080a. If so, make sure your clock is set correctly to ensure Windows downloads and installs updates properly. Here’s how to sync your PC's date and time settings.

4. Turn on the toggle next to**Set the time automatically** .

 Also, make sure your time zone is correct, otherwise Windows may ignore new updates.

## 4\. Run SFC and DISM Command

 If the error still persists, there might be a corrupt system file. As such, try running SFC and DISM to see if that helps. The System File Checker (SFC) scans and repairs damaged files on your system while the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool handles more critical system errors.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Search for "Command Prompt" and select Run as administrator.
2. If UAC appears on the screen, click**Yes** to continue.

3. Type**sfc /scannow** in Command Prompt window and press Enter.

 It will take some time for the process to be completed. After the update is complete, restart your computer and try updating Windows again. If the update still fails, run the DISM command to repair corrupted images and restore system files. Here's how to do it

1. [Open the Command Prompt with admin access](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) .
2. In the Command Prompt window, type the below command and hit Enter.  
Dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealthDism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

 It may take a while for the process to complete. Once the DISM command has been run, restart the computer to see if the error has been fixed.

## 5\. Reset Windows Update Components

 Is the error still occurring? There may be corrupted update components causing the installation to fail and causing further issues. To clear out previously downloaded updates, you can reset the Windows Update Components.

 In this way, you will be able to start over with new downloads to ensure that everything runs smoothly.

To reset Windows Update Components, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + X** on your keyboard and select Terminal (Admin).
2. Next, type the following commands, and press Enter after each one:  
net stop bitsnet stop wuauservnet stop appidsvcnet stop cryptsvcren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.oldren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.oldnet start bitsnet start wuauservnet start appidsvcnet start cryptsvc

 After you run the above commands, close the Command Prompt and try running Windows Update again.

## 6\. Perform a Clean Boot

 In case the problem persists, perform a clean boot procedure on your computer. A clean boot is a process of starting your computer in a minimal state and disabling all startup programs and services that don't ship with Windows.

 This helps to narrow down the cause of the error by eliminating any third-party software as a potential source of it.

To perform a clean boot, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on Start and select**Run** from the menu list.
2. Type "MSConfig" in the dialog box, then press Enter. The System Configuration window will open.
3. On the**General** tab, click the**Selective Startup** checkbox.

4. Then clear the**Load startup items** checkbox and ensure that**Load system services** are checked.
5. On the Services tab, check the**Hide all Microsoft services** box.  
![Hide all Microsoft Services option in Clean Boot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/hide-all-microsoft-services.jpg)

1. Then click on the**Disable all** button.
2. Now go to the**Startup** tab and click on**Open Task Manager** .
3. In the Task Manager window, select each startup item and click**Disable** .
4. Close the Task Manager and go back to the System Configuration window.
5. Click on**Apply** and**OK** to save the changes.
6. Restart your PC and check to see if it works.

 Once you have completed the steps above, and it resolves the problem, you can re-enable the services and startup items that you have disabled one by one in System Configuration. If the problem reappears, the item you just re-enabled is the culprit; uninstall or update it and see if that fixes things.
