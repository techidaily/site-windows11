## Top 4 Microcomputers: Pure Windows Environment

 Single-board computers (SBCs) are pretty capable devices and part of their appeal is the excellent price-to-performance ratio. However, a good number of these tiny computers struggle to perform everyday tasks that most of us have come to take for granted, such as running the Windows operating system.

 **MUO VIDEO OF THE DAY**

 **SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT**

 Some of these boards won’t run Windows at all, and some of those that can run it perform poorly and stutter every step of the way. Your options are limited if you're looking for a single-board computer that can run Windows properly. However, there are a few devices out there that can do the job quite well.

## Windows System Requirements

 Most SBCs have processors that are ARM-based which affords them[certain benefits over x86 processors](https://www.makeuseof.com/x86-vs-arm-which-architecture-should-pc-use/) , such as being inexpensive and energy-efficient. With Windows on ARM, you can run Windows and emulate standard x86 applications. It isn’t perfect yet, but it is getting there very slowly. x86-based single-board computers are generally better suited to running Windows.

 To determine single-board computers that will be able to run Windows, we need to establish the criteria they need to meet. So, let’s take a look at the basic requirements to run Windows 10 and Windows 11.

**Windows 10 system requirements:**

* **Processor:** 1GHz or faster
* **RAM:** 1GB for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit
* **Storage:** 16GB for 32-bit OS or 20GB for 64-bit OS
* **Graphics card:** DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver
* **Display:** 800 x 600

**Windows 11 system requirements:**

* **Processor:** 1GHz or faster with two or more cores
* **RAM:** 4GB
* **Storage:** 64GB or larger
* **Display:** High definition (720p) display; greater than 9" diagonally
* **Trusted Platform Module** : TPM version 2.0

## 4. UDOO BOLT V8

 The UDOO BOLT V8 is quite expensive at $550, but it packs a lot of specs that may appeal to users who need the heavy-lifting power. For purists, the V8 is not technically a single-board computer, as the RAM is inserted in SODIMM sockets and is not embedded in the board itself.

## Run Windows on a Single-Board Computer

 Both ARM and x64 single-board computers are capable of running the Windows operating system. That aside, you will have an easier time running Windows on x64 computers. If you're planning to use an ARM SBC as your daily driver, Windows is not the best choice currently. You'll be better served with an operating system created specifically for ARM computers such as Armbian or a supported Android distribution.
