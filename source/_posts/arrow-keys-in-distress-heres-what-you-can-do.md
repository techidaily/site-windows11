## Arrow Keys in Distress? Here's What You Can Do

 The arrow keys are handy for day-to-day tasks; however, like any other hardware component, these keys can sometimes stop working.

 In this guide, we'll show you how to troubleshoot and fix the keyboard arrow keys not working on a Windows machine.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 Restarting your computer is the first and simplest method to try when your arrow keys are not working. This can often resolve minor software glitches that might be causing the issue.

 Before you restart, make sure to save any open documents or projects so that you don’t lose your progress.

## 2\. Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter

 If restarting your computer doesn’t fix the arrow keys not working, you can try running the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. This tool is designed to detect and fix common hardware problems with your computer, including keyboard issues.

To run the troubleshooter, follow these steps:

1. [Run Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) .
2. In the elevated command prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:  
msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic
3. The Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter will now open. Click**Next** to start the scan process, and follow the instructions on the screen.

## 3\. Run the Keyboard Troubleshooter

 If the arrow keys still don’t work, you can run the “Keyboard Troubleshooter”. This tool is similar to the “Hardware and Devices” troubleshooter, but it focuses on keyboard issues. To run it, follow these steps:

1. Open the Settings window. If you need help, see our guide on [how to open the Windows System Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
2. In the Settings menu, click**System > Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters** .
3. Scroll down to the**Keyboard** section and click**Run** .

 Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process and then check if it solves the issue. If not, continue to the next solution.

## 4\. Try Using a Different Keyboard

 This problem can also appear if you're using a faulty keyboard. So, if the arrow keys still don’t work after applying the methods above, try using a different keyboard. You can purchase it from an electronics store or borrow one from a friend to test it out.

 Connect the new keyboard to your computer and check to see if the arrow keys are now working. If yes, it means that your original keyboard was damaged and needs to be replaced.

2. Type**devmgmt.msc** in the dialog box and press Enter to open Device Manager.
3. In the Device Manager window, expand the**Keyboards** category.
