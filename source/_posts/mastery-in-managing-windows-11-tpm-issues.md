## Mastery in Managing Windows 11 TPM Issues

 The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a security chip that safeguards your computer against malware and other attacks. It plays a crucial role in the installation of Windows 11 and is also an integral part of several security features like Windows Hello and BitLocker.

* The TPM stores crucial information about drivers and applications installed on your computer. Therefore, you must reset the TPM before selling your computer to protect your privacy.
* Clearing the TPM can also help you troubleshoot problems related to security, encryption, and authentication.
* You should clear the TPM before clean installing a new operating system. This way, the OS can fully deploy its TPM-based functionalities like attestation.
