## Fixing Win 10/11'S GeForce NotaXC0F1103F Error

 Some GeForce Now users have reported that their app no longer works because of error 0xc0f1103f. Those players see that error code when they start the GeForce Now app or games with it. Error 0xc0f1103f has a message that says, “Your system does not meet the minimum requirements for streaming.”

 That issue occurs on PCs that do meet the minimum streaming system requirements. Is the same error stopping you from playing GeForce Now titles? If so, this is how you can fix error 0xc0f1103f in Windows 10 and 11.

## Double-Check That Your PC Matches GeForce Now's System Requirements

 If you’re a first-time GeForce Now user, double-check your PC meets the streaming service’s system requirements before troubleshooting. Open the[GeForce Now system requirement page](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce-now/system-reqs/) for Windows PCs to check hardware requirements.

 You can check how your PC’s specs match up by[opening the System Information app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-system-information/) . The system summary shows most of the essential hardware specs for GeForce Now streaming. You can view GPU details by clicking**Components** \>**Display** in the System Information app.

 You’ll need to upgrade your PC if it doesn’t match a system requirement. Desktop users can add new graphics adapters or even processors to their PCs if required. If your PC does indeed match all the GeForce Now requirements, proceed with the troubleshooting below.

## 1\. Double-Check if GeForce Now’s Servers Are Operational

 This error can occur because the GeForce Now server is down. For example, the server could be down for maintenance. You can check the service status for various regions on the[GeForce Now service status](https://status.geforcenow.com/) page. If a server for your region is down, wait until the service is operational again before opening the GeForce Now app again.

You can do that by opening the properties window for the GeForce Now EXE (Application) and selecting the**Run as administrator** checkbox.
