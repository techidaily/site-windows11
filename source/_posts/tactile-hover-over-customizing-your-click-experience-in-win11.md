## Tactile Hover Over: Customizing Your Click Experience in Win11

 A mouse pointer is like your digital hand; it lets you see the cursor’s position on your screen and helps you control elements through your PC’s mouse or touchpad. In addition, the mouse pointer indicates where you can input, select and highlight text on your computer.

 Enhancing your mouse pointer changes how you interact with your computer by improving your productivity with tasks. Luckily, Windows 11 features some accessibility options through which you can configure your cursor to what works best for you.

## How to Customize Your Mouse Pointer

 The mouse pointer is an integral part of computing, and you perform many functions on your computer through it. You can select, point, and execute programs on your computer by moving and clicking the mouse pointer.

 It changes form depending on where it is placed; when hovered over editable text, it changes to a text cursor. Meanwhile, it changes to a hand when you hover over a link and opens up the web page when clicked.

 For a tool that is responsible for most operations on your computer, it’s crucial that your mouse pointer is made as accessible and efficient as possible. And, on your Windows PC, there are a number of customization options to help you achieve this.

So, without further ado, let’s get into them.

### 1\. Choosing Your Mouse Pointer Style

 To [change the style of your Mouse pointer](https://www.makeuseof.com/change-your-cursor-on-windows/) , head over to**Settings > Accessibility** on your computer.

![Screenshot accessibility settings windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-accessibility-settings-windows-11.jpg)

 Next, click the**Mouse pointer and touch** category. You have the options White, Black, Inverted, and Custom under**Mouse pointer style.** As such, you can choose any of them to change your pointer style.

 Using the**Custom** item, you can choose a custom color for your pointer from the recommended ones or click**Choose another color** beneath to use a different one.

### 2\. Adjusting Your Mouse Cursor Size

 If you would like your pointer to appear bigger, drag the**Size** slider to increase its size.

### 3\. Increasing your Mouse Pointer Speed

 Your mouse’s pointer speed has a great impact on its performance and is often crucial to improving your efficiency. To adjust your pointer speed, go to**Settings > Bluetooth & devices** and click on the**Mouse** category.

![screenshot of mouse pointer speed settings windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-mouse-pointer-speed-settings-windows-11.jpg)

 Drag the**Mouse pointer speed** slider to adjust your pointer speed.

### 4\. Changing Your Primary Mouse Button

 The left mouse button is the default primary mouse button, typically used to activate or select on-screen elements. It is used for clicking, double-clicking, and drag-and-drop actions. On the other hand, the right mouse button is mostly used to open up a context menu, which provides more information on the selected item.

 The default setting might be convenient enough for right-handers since they can access the primary mouse button with their right index finger easily. But it might be uncomfortable for left-handed users. Or it could be that you simply prefer it the other way around.

 Windows 11 provides quick settings to switch the functions of both buttons. So, you don't have to stick with the default primary and secondary mouse positions. To do so, simply go to**Settings > Bluetooth & devices.**

 Click on**Mouse** and navigate to the**Primary Mouse Button** drop-down menu. You can switch your primary mouse button to either**Left or Right.**

### 5\. Additional Mouse Pointer Settings

 To tweak your mouse further, head over to**Additional mouse settings** on the same page.

![screenshot of additional mouse settings page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-additional-mouse-settings-page.jpg)

 From here, you can enable**ClickLock** to let you drag and drop without holding down the mouse button.

![how to enable ClickLock on additional mouse settings page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-additional-mouse-settings-page-2.jpg)

 Click the**Pointers** tab to select a mouse scheme and customize the different shapes of the mouse pointer. You can also [use a custom mouse cursor](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-custom-mouse-cursor/) by clicking**Browse** to download online. Lastly, you can tick the**Enhance pointer shadow** checkbox if you’d prefer that.

![Screenshot of mouse pointer options windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-mouse-pointer-options-windows-11.jpg)

 From the**Pointer Options** tab, you can select a pointer speed and**Enhance pointer precision** with the checkbox. If you’d like the pointer to move to its default in a dialogue box, click**Snap To.**

 Under**Visibility** , you can choose if you want your pointer to display trails, hide the pointer while typing, or show the location of the pointer when the Control key is clicked.

 Hit**Apply** afterward to implement your changes.

## How to Customize Your Text Cursor

 The text cursor is that blinking vertical line that indicates the point where you can enter or highlight text on your screen. The following settings show you how to enhance the look of your text cursor.

### 1\. Using the Text Cursor Indicator

 The text indicator can help you find a cursor easily in a sea of text. By enabling the text indicator in settings, you won’t have to waste time searching for the text cursor while typing.

 To turn it on, open **Settings > Accessibility** and select the **Text cursor** option.  Toggle on the text cursor indicator. ![screenshot of text cursor settings page windows 11](https://static0.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-of-text-cursor-settings-page-windows-11.jpg)

 To change the indicator’s color, choose one of the displayed colors or select a custom one. You can also adjust its size by dragging the**Size** slider. View the top to preview your changes.

### 2\. Changing the Text Cursor’s Thickness

 You might want your text cursor to appear bolder on the screen, so it's more visible. To do this, use the slider in the**Text Cursor Thickness** section.
