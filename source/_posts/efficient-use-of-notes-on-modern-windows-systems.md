## Efficient Use of Notes on Modern Windows Systems

 You can add notes to the Windows 11/10 desktop with Sticky Notes. However, you can't add any notes to software windows with that accessory. That's a pity since such a feature would enable you to stick all kinds of instructional and hotkey notes for apps to their windows, not to mention task reminders, etc.

 However, Stick A Note and Notezilla are two third-party apps with which you can stick notes to software windows, which we'll look at here.

## How to Add Sticky Notes to Software Windows With Stick a Note

 Stick A Note is a freeware and portable note-taking software for Windows 11 and Windows 10 from the talented solo developer Anand Gupta. By pressing that app's hotkey, you can add a note to any software window you wish. Follow these steps to get stuck in with Stick A Note:

1. First, open the[Stick A Note](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Diary-Organizers-Calendar/Stick-A-Note.shtml) Softpedia page.
2. Select Softpedia's**Download Now** and**Secure Download (US)** options.
3. [Bring up Windows 11's Explorer file manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) from the taskbar by clicking its folder library icon.
4. Navigate to the folder the Stick A Note ZIP file downloaded in.
5. Extract the downloaded**Stick A Note 3.0.1 (1).zip** archive. Our[how-to unzip files in Windows 10 guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/) includes instructions for extracting ZIPs.

1. Double-click**Stick A Note.exe** in that software's extracted folder.
2. Next, double-click the**Stick A Note** system tray icon.
3. Click the**Settings** button on the app's window.

4. Select the**Shift** checkbox to change Stick A Note's hotkey to**Win** +**Shift** +**N** . This is necessary because Windows 11 already has a**Win** +**N** keyboard shortcut for notifications that matches this software's default hotkey.

 Or you can set Stick A Note to automatically show notes after opening software windows. To do so, right-click the program's system tray icon and select**Settings** . Select the**Auto Show Note for the Active Program** checkbox, and click the**OK** option.

 To remove a note, click the**Edit** option in it; press the**Delete** button on the editing window. Select**Yes** on the dialogue box asks to confirm the note's deletion.

 Stick A Note is a little short on formatting options. For instance, you can't apply bold or italic formatting to a note's text. Nor are there any font selection or size options.

 However, you can at least change the color and size of the notes. To do that, right-click the**Stick a Note** system tray icon and select**Settings** \>**Note Settings** ; choose an alternative option on the**Note Color** drop-down menu. Enter values up to**600** in the size boxes to resize the notes.
