## Insider Knowledge on Folder Tagsging in Windows Explorer

 Do you want to add extra details to your PC's folders with comments? Here’s how you can add info for a folder to the **Comments** column in Windows 11 File Explorer.

 File Explorer has a **Comments** column in which users can add comments to files within Explorer by modifying tags for them on the Details tab. However, folders don’t have editable tags like files do. Nevertheless, you can still add comments to folders even though File Explorer doesn’t have a built-in option for doing so.

## How to Enable File Explorer's Comments Column

 First, you must set File Explorer to show the **Comments** column that will include the comment for a folder. That column isn’t enabled by default within Explorer. Enable the **Comments** column for a folder as follows.

1. [Open File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and go to the directory containing the folder you want to add a comment to.
2. Right-click on the **Type** column, or any other, and select **More**.

4. Click **OK** to add the **Comments** column.

 A **Comments** column will now be visible in the directory opened. That is where you’ll see the comment added to a folder. You can expand the width of that column by placing the mouse cursor on the left or right side of the **Comments** column header, holding the left mouse button, and dragging the mouse cursor.
