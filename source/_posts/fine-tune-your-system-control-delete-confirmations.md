## Fine-Tune Your System: Control Delete Confirmations

 When you delete a file or folder on Windows, it is automatically moved to the Recycle Bin without any confirmation. If you don't want that, you can configure Windows to display a confirmation dialog when deleting files.

 You can enable or disable the delete confirmation dialog via Recycle Bin Properties, Registry Editor, or Group Policy Editor. Let's go over each of these methods one by one.

## 1\. Enable or Disable Delete Confirmation Dialog via Recycle Bin's Properties

 The easiest way to enable or disable the delete confirmation prompt on Windows is through Recycle Bin Properties. Here's how to go about it.

1. Right-click on the**Recycle Bin** icon on the desktop and select**Properties** .
2. In the**Recycle Bin Properties** window, tick the**Display delete confirmation dialog** checkbox.
3. Click**Apply** followed by**OK** .

 Once you complete the above steps, Windows should display the delete confirmation dialog every time you move something to the Recycle Bin.

 If you want to disable the delete confirmation dialog in the future, repeat the above steps and uncheck the**Display delete confirmation dialog** checkbox.
