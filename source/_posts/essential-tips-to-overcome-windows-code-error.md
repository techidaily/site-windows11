## 2\. Perform a Complete system shutdown

 Windows OS enables the fast startup option by default. Even if you restart your system, or shut it down, it preserves the system state using hibernate. So, you need to perform a complete system shutdown and then power it back on to close and restart all background services.

Here’s how to perform a complete system shutdown:

1. Press**Win + X** to launch the Power user menu. Scroll down and select the**Terminal (Admin)** option from the list.
2. The Terminal app will open with an instance of a command prompt with admin privileges.
3. Type the**shutdown /s /f /t 0** command and press the**enter** key.
4. Your system will power off. It will take a tad bit longer that a normal shutdown procedure.
5. Now, restart your Windows PC and try to install the Windows update.

## 3\. Restart Windows Update services

 Windows Update uses a bunch of background services to fetch and download updates. If these services aren’t running automatically, you will encounter an error. These include**Windows Update Service** ,**Windows Installer Service** ,**Cryptographic Services** , and**Background Intelligent Transfer Service** .

Repeat the following steps to start the necessary services:

1. Press**Win + R** to [launch the Run dialog box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) . Type**services.msc** and press the**enter** key
2. Services utility will launch on your system. Now locate the**Background Intelligent Transfer** service in the list.
3. Double-click on the BITS service to open the**properties** window. Set the**Startup Type** as**Automatic** and click on the**Apply** button.

5. Similarly, set all the services as automatic and manually start them.
6. **Close** the Services window and reattempt the Windows update.

## 4\. Run the Disk Cleanup Tool

5. Disk Cleanup will close and redirect you to pick the appropriate drive. Click on the**OK** button.
6. Lastly, click on the**Delete files** button.

## 5\. Rename the SoftwareDistribution Folder

 Windows update stores its content in the SoftwareDistribution folder. Since it is located inside the Windows folder in the C drive, you mustn’t delete it. Instead, you can rename the folder to force the update service to recreate the folder again.

Repeat the following steps:

1. Open the Start menu and search CMD. Press Ctrl + Shift + Enter to open the command prompt with admin privileges.
2. Type the following commands to stop all the Windows update-related services:  
 net stop wuauserv net stop cryptSvc net stop bits net stop msiserver

net start wuauserv net start cryptSvc net start bits net start msiserver  
![Rename the SoftwareDistribution Folder 3](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/rename-the-softwaredistribution-folder-3.jpg)
6. Lastly,**restart** your system and visit the following folder location:**C:\\Windows** . You will notice that there is a new SoftwareDistribution folder in that location.
7. Open the Windows update in Settings and try to download and install updates.

## 6\. Delete the Pending.xml file

 The pending.xml file contains all the pending Windows update tasks. Oftentimes, it can interfere with installing new updates because there are already multiple incomplete old update tasks. So, you must delete this file and proceed with the Windows update.

Retrace the following steps to delete the pending.xml file:

1. Log in with an administrator account. Then, press**Win + E** to launch the file explorer.
2. Navigate to the**C:\\Windows\\WinSxS** folder.
3. Locate the**pending.xml** in the**WinSxS** folder and right-click on it.
4. Press the**Shift** key and click on the**Delete** option.

## 7\. Manually Download Windows Updates

 If you are unable to download a specific Windows update using the Settings page, consider a direct download and install approach. Visit the Microsoft Update Catalog website and search for the KB update you want to download. However, you first have to check the corresponding update number which is failing to download and install on your system.
