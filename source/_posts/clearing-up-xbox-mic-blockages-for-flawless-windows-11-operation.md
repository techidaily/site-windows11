## 2\. Connect a Headset Microphone with a Different PC Port

## 5\. Select the Right Audio Input Device in the Xbox App

1. Start the Xbox app.
2. Click your user profile name in the top-left corner of the appâ€™s window.
3. Select**Settings** to bring up a window.  
![The Settings menu option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/settings-menu-option.jpg)

 If you set the**Default** input option, youâ€™ll need to make sure youâ€™re using your PCâ€™s default microphone. To do that, go to the**Recording** tab as instructed in steps one to four of the previous resolution. Then select the microphone to utilize with the Xbox app there and click**Set Default** .

## 6\. Reset the Xbox App

 The Xbox app, like others, has a**Reset** troubleshooting option you can select in Settings. That option clears the appâ€™s data to fix issues.

## 7\. Reinstall the Driver for the Audio Input Device

 A faulty or corrupted audio input device driver is another potential cause for the microphone not working with the Xbox app. Though that would also probably cause issues with using the same microphone with other apps.

1. Open Device Manager by pressing**Win + X** and selecting**Device Manager** .
2. Extend**Audio inputs and outputs** by double-clicking that category.
