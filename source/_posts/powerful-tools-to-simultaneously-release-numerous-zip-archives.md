## Powerful Tools to Simultaneously Release Numerous Zip Archives

 Many users need to extract ZIP archives on Windows 11/10 PCs. The built-in archive extraction tool within Windows is fine for unzipping single ZIP files. However, that tool doesn’t have an option for batch extracting multiple ZIP files. This means you must extract multiple ZIP archives one at a time when utilizing that extraction utility.

 So, Windows’ built-in extraction tool isn’t ideal when you need to unzip numerous ZIP files. It’s better to utilize a third-party app like 7-Zip or ExtractNow that enables you to extract multiple ZIP archives. This is how you can simultaneously extract multiple ZIP files with those software packages.

## How to Simultaneously Extract Multiple ZIP Archives With 7-Zip

 7-Zip is one of the [best file compression and extraction tools](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/the-top-3-file-compression-extraction-softwares/) for Windows. That software is freely available and widely compatible with Windows platforms dating back to 2000\. You can batch extract multiple archives to different folders with that software as follows.

1. Open the [7-ZIP webpage](https://7-zip.org/).
2. Click **Download** for the 64-bit 7-Zip software.  
![The 7-Zip download page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7-zip-download-page.jpg)
3. Click the pinned taskbar shortcut for [opening Windows File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) and go to the folder your browser downloaded 7-Zip to.
4. Double-click the **7z2301-x64** file.
5. Click **Install** to install 7-Zip in the directory specified within the **Destination folder** box.
6. Select **Close** to exit the installer.

 Now it's time to put the app to use:

1. Open the Start menu and click the 7-Zip folder at the top of the apps list. Then click **7-Zip File Manager** to run the software.
2. Navigate to a folder that includes some ZIP archives within the 7-Zip window.
3. Select multiple ZIP files to extract by holding the **Ctrl** key and clicking on them in 7-Zip.
4. Click **Extract** to bring up an extraction window.

5. If you want to change the folder that includes the extracted subfolders, click the **ellipsis** button. Then choose a different directory and click **OK**.  
![The Extract window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/the-extract-window.jpg)
6. Select **OK** to extract the selected ZIP archives.

 This will extract all the selected ZIP archives to different subfolders. Those extracted subfolders will have the same names as the ZIP files you extracted. Close out of 7-Zip and then bring up the directory you selected to extract the archives in to open the extracted folders from there.

 The "**\*\\**" in 7-Zip’s **Extract** window means the archives get extracted to new folders. If you prefer to extract all selected archives to the same subfolder, delete the "**\*\\"** from the text box. Input a new folder name at the end of the chosen path. Then 7-Zip will batch extract all the ZIP files to the new folder added in the **Extract to** box.

![The Browse for Folder window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/browse-for-folder.jpg)

 By default, this software will always ask you where to extract files. However, you can change ExtractNow to automatically unzip ZIP files without asking via its settings. To do so, click the **Settings** button and select the **Destination** tab. Then select the **Automatically extract archives to** radio button.

![The Destination tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/destination-tab.jpg)

 If you want to set a location to always extract selected ZIPs, click the **Browse for Folder** button; select a directory within the Browse for Folder window and click **OK**. Then select **OK** on the Settings window to save options.

 ExtractNow also has lots of other settings you can configure. Check out the [ExtractNow manual](https://extractnow.com/#/documentation) for details about what all those settings do.
