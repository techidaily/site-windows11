## How to Unlink Your OneDrive From Your Microsoft Account on Windows

 By default, OneDrive, Microsoft’s cloud-based storage service, is launched when you start Windows. This helps the service synchronize with the cloud and update your files on the device on which you are signing in.

 While this may keep you connected with the latest versions of your files across devices, this can have downsides too. It can slow down your PC’s performance. Alternatively, you may just wish to have this automatic sync turned off. Here’s how to unlink your OneDrive from your Windows 10 PC to stop automatic sync.
