## Fast Track to Windows 11 ARM with Easy ISO Setup Instructions

 Windows 10 ARM-based PCs were riddled with many limitations. With the release of Windows 11 ARM, Microsoft has improved upon some limitations as it now comes with support for 64-bit apps, among others.

 If you are using an unsupported ARM-based PC or want to install Windows 11 on your Mac computer, this guide will help. Here we show you how to download and install Windows 11 ARM with ISO. We also briefly discuss the limitations and compatible ARM-based devices that may support Windows 11.

## Can Windows 11 Run on ARM?

 Like its predecessor, the newest iteration of Microsoft's popular operating system can run on compatible ARM devices. However, Windows 11 now uses the new ARM64EC application binary interface (ABI) for ARM devices. It helps developers achieve native speed and makes it compatible with x64 apps and their dependencies.

 Microsoft explains in detail [ARM64EC and its potential on its Windows Blogs](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/06/28/announcing-arm64ec-building-native-and-interoperable-apps-for-windows-11-on-arm/) .

 If you have an ARM-based device that hasn't officially received the upgrade yet or want to install Windows 11 on your ARM-based Mac, you can do so using the Windows 11 ARM64 ISO file. That said,[Windows 11 and M1 Macs bring some additional challenges](https://www.makeuseof.com/will-windows-11-work-on-mac/) to the table that you should be aware of.

## What are the Limitations of a Windows 11 ARM-based PC?

 The biggest limitation of Windows 10 ARM-based PC was its incompatibility with 64-bit Windows applications. Microsoft has resolved this issue by ditching Compiled Hybrid Portable Executable (CHPE) for the new ARM64EC ABI in Windows 11.

 Yet, there are a couple of other limitations that you'll encounter when you run Windows 11 on an ARM-based device. Most limitations are on the software front as listed below:

* Windows Fax and Scan feature is not supported on ARM-based PCs yet.
* Some third-party antivirus programs may not work on an ARM-based PC. You can use the built-in Windows Security solution as an alternative.
* Games using OpenGL version 3.4 or above will not work unless the developers have developed ARM-specific drivers for the app.
* Peripherals and devices will only work if the required drivers are built into Windows 11 or if your device manufacturer has developed drivers for ARM devices.

## How to Download Windows 11 ARM64 ISO

 To install Windows 11 on your ARM-compatible device, you will need the ARM version of Windows 11\. You can use UUP Dump to download the Windows 11 ARM64 ISO for the latest and older builds.
