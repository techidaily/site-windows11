## Unveiling Microsoft's New Surface Laptop 6: Exclusive Release with No Retail Availability

Microsoft just opened pre-orders for the new Surface Laptop 6 for Business. This laptop, which is exclusive to enterprise customers, places an emphasis on raw performance and artificial intelligence. A consumer-grade version of the Surface Laptop 6 is expected to arrive later this year.

 The new [Surface Laptop 6 for Business](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-laptop-6-for-business/8pz3fvs57qcv?) comes with an Intel Core Ultra H-series CPU. Customers can choose between the Intel Core Ultra 5 135H or Intel Core Ultra 7 165H, According to Microsoft and Intel, these processors will deliver desktop-like performance and next-gen AI task management. Common processes that utilize AI, such as Copilot or webcam-enhancement features, should have a minimal impact on both battery life and overall laptop performance.

 When paired with the Core Ultra 5 chip, the Surface Laptop 6 can be configured with up to 32GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. These figures leap to a respective 64GB and 1TB if you opt for the Core Ultra 7 processor. Microsoft also offers an integrated smart card reader with some configurations of Surface Laptop 6, and all configurations feature a new 1080p webcam, plus Microsoft's dedicated [Copilot key](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-cutting-edge-techniques-for-google-meet-aesthetic-enhancement/).

 Naturally, the new Surface Laptop 6 for Business was joined by a 2-in-1 tablet; the [Surface Pro 10 for Business](https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2024/03/21/introducing-surface-pro-10-for-business-and-surface-laptop-6-for-business/). Both devices are AI-oriented and feature a familiar design, which comes as a bit of a surprise, as rumors suggested that the Laptop 6 and Pro 10 would both receive a substantial makeover. Microsoft may be saving its redesign for the non-business versions of Laptop 6 and Pro 10, which are expected to launch in mid-late 2024.

 Enterprise customers who are choosing between these new devices should know that the Surface Laptop 6 features a more powerful, higher-wattage CPU. Also, the Surface Laptop 6 comes in 13.5 and 15-inch flavors, while the Surface Pro 10 is only available in a 13-inch configuration. Microsoft claims that both devices "are even easier to service and repair" and have built-in QR codes that link to service guides, though I'm willing to assume that the laptop is more repairable than the tablet.

 The [Surface Laptop 6 for Business](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-laptop-6-for-business/8pz3fvs57qcv?) is available for pre-order with prices starting at $1,200\. Orders begin shipping in Aprilâ€”Microsoft quotes an April 10th delivery for my ZIP code, but the expected delivery date may vary based on your location.
