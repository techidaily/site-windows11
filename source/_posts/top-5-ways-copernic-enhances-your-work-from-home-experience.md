## Simplify Digital Organization: Unleash Copernic’s Advanced Search Capabilities to Streamline Your Files

Did you make a resolution to be more organized in 2024? Rather than spending hours at your computer creating folders and weeding through old emails and files, why not let Copernic search tools do the hard work for you!

 If you’re new to Copernic, you may not realize the organizing opportunities you have. While you certainly may use the tool to help you create folders for your files, you don’t need to! You are also able to forgo that step entirely and simply use our search software any time you are searching for a file.

 Let’s start at the beginning. To execute a search, on the main screen, you can enter any word. This can be a file name, a word from the file itself, or a word contained in an image. In this scenario, we do a search for the word “art.”

 The search sends back over 2,000 results. This seems like a lot to sort through but there are additional tricks you can use to narrow down these results. If you know you are seeking a particular filetype, the icons under the search bar can help. The number under each icon tells you how many files in that category contain the word (or part of the word). Simply hovering your mouse over the icon will tell you which category each icon represents.

 Continuing our search, we remembered the file we need is a PDF written a month or so ago. We also know that it is a file saved to the hard drive of the computer and not in a shared drive. With this information, we can use the refinements on the left-hand side of the dashboard to narrow our search. In seconds, we brought our results from 152 documents to 7, a much easier number!

 If you find more than one possible match, you can use the preview option to locate the correct file. Simply click on the file you’d like to preview, and the file will display.

 If it’s the correct file, you may click on the drop-down menu that says “Open” on the right.
