## Insight Into Windows Maintenance Framework

 We all love staying up-to-date with the latest Windows versions. But have you ever wondered what happens in the backend? How does Microsoft send Windows updates to our devices?

 This is where the Windows Update and Update Orchestrator services come into play. You may be wondering: what these services do and how they work together.

 Do not worry; we will explain everything about both services and how you can fix almost all Windows update errors with them.

## What Is the Windows Update Service?

 The Windows Update service is a process (task) that handles everything related to updates on Windows. If this sounds confusing, then understand it as a small-sized application that runs in the background. It ensures that you receive all the updates on time.

 This service takes care of [downloading and installing Windows updates](<http://downloading> and installing Windows updates), including security patches, and bug fixes, to name a few. So now you can imagine how helpful this service is on Windows.

 If it fails to work for any reason, you may witness a series of Windows update errors. This is why most internet guides suggest you restart the Windows Update service when an update fails to install.

 To better understand what could go wrong, explore our article on the [common reasons why Windows updates fail](https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-why-windows-updates-fail/).

## What's the Purpose of the Update Orchestrator Service?

 The Update Orchestrator service helps your Windows device fetch updates from Microsoft's server.

 This service starts in the background when you open your computer and connect directly to Microsoft's update server. After finding an update on their server, it checks for device compatibility and fetches the required details.

 This way, when you click the "**Check for updates**" button, you sometimes see the latest updates available for downloading.

 Think of this service as a scheduler that helps manage the timing and installation of updates. So, if the [latest Windows update is unavailable](https://www.makeuseof.com/why-is-the-latest-windows-update-not-showing-on-my-pc-/) on your computer, restarting the Update Orchestrator service may help.

 Now that you know about both services, let's look at how to fix almost all the Windows update issues with them.

### 1\. Restart Windows Update and Update Orchestrator Services

 If one of the core Windows services crashes or stops for no reason, update error codes are not far behind. In such a case, your priority should be to restart them first.

 Here's how to restart the Windows update and Update orchestrator services:

1. Press **Win + R** to bring up the Run app. It allows you to launch any Windows program using its executable name or file path.
2. In the Run dialog box, enter **services.msc**. Click **OK** to run the command and open the Services app.

3. Scroll down the list until you locate the **Update Orchestrator** service. Right-click on it and choose **Restart** from the context menu that appears.
