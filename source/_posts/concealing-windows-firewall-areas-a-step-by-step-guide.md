## Why It's Important to Hide the Firewall & Network Area in Windows Security

[Windows Security](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-quick-security-guide/) is your one-stop security center to protect your personal data and network settings. It is divided into different security sections for better and faster security management.

 One of these is the Firewall & Network protection area. This is where you can view the Microsoft Defender Firewall status and the type of networks your device is connected to. You can also use it to [block or allow an app through the firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/) and reset firewall settings.

 Therefore, keeping this area hidden is important, especially if you share your computer with someone else. You must be signed in as an administrator if you want to hide the Firewall & Network area, so check out [how to enable or disable the built-in administrator account](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-enable-disable-built-in-administrator-account/) on Windows if you need to turn it on.
