## Cleanse Your Search Box of Windows Graphics

 Microsoft keeps introducing creative features in all Windows versions, which make the user experience much more fun. However, not all features are for everyone.

 One such feature that has been getting mixed reviews from users is illustrations inside the Windows Search bar. In this guide, we will take a look at what these colorful icons are and how to disable them if you want to declutter your search bar.

## Why Are There Pictures in Your Search Box?

 The illustrations in the search bar are a part of the "Search Highlights" feature that Microsoft introduced beforehand. When you hover your cursor over the illustration or click it, you will see relevant content and images.

 This content is typically related to the illustrations on display. For instance, if you see a boots icon on the taskbar, the content is most likely going to be related to hiking, trails, or something similar. The pop-up window will then show options like trials near you, hiking tips, and tent shops.

 This information is different for both organizations and regular users. If you are signed in to Windows using your work account, you will see information regarding your organization and its employees. On your home PC, you'll see more generic informational content.

## How to Disable the Illustrations in Windows Search Icons

 Even though this feature is creative, it may not be for everyone. Fortunately, Microsoft allows you to [customize the Windows taskbar](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-customize-taskbar/) in a variety of ways, and you can disable the pictures by disabling search highlights in the taskbar settings.

Here is how you can do that:

1. Right-click in an empty space on your taskbar.
