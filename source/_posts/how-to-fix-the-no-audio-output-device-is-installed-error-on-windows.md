<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Check if you have accidentally disabled your audio device. While the audio troubleshooter should be able to detect and recommend the same, you can also enable the audio device manually.

 To check and enable your audio output device:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the **Run** dialog.
2. Type **mmsys.cpl** and click **OK** to open the **Sound** dialog.
3. In the **Playback** tab, locate your audio output device. If no device is listed, right-click within the **Playback** section and select **Show disabled devices.**
4. If your audio device is greyed out, right-click and select **Enable**.
5. Next, select the device and click the **Set Default** button to set the device as default**.**
6. Restart your PC and check if the no audio output device is installed error is resolved.

## 5\. Check if the Audio Services are Running

 The Windows Audio Endpoint Service and Windows Audio Service are the two essential services for the audio to work on your PC. If these services are not running, your audio device may not function properly.

 So, ensure the two services are running and set to startup automatically. Follow these steps to do the same:

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**.
2. Type **services.msc** and click **OK** to open the **Services** snap-in.  
![Windows Audio Endpoint Service](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/windows-audio-endpoint-service.jpg)
3. Next, locate and right-click on **Windows Audio Endpoint Service Builder.**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

7. Right-click on **Windows Audio Endpoint Builder** service again and then select **Restart**.
8. Next, repeat the steps for the **Windows Audio service.**
9. Once done, close the Services snap-in.

## 6\. Uninstall or Disable Any Third-Party Driver Updater Tools

 Third-party driver update utilities allow you to scan and update all the drivers for your computer from one place. While a handy tool, this may conflict with your audio component and Windows’s ability to detect the device.

 To fix the problem, disable or remove any driver update utility such as Avast Driver Updater installed on your PC. Then run the audio troubleshooter again to see if that helps resolve the issue. Sometimes, you may need to remove the updater app to disable it completely.

## 7\. Repair the Windows Image With DISM

![DISM scan health restore health command prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dism-scan-health-restore-health-command-prompt.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Deployment Image Service Management (DISM) is a built-in Windows image repair command-line utility. If the audio problem is triggered by an issue with your system image, this tool can repair the image to restore the audio functionality on your PC.

 To run the DISM tool in Command Prompt :

1. Press **Win + S** to open **Windows Search.**
2. Type **cmd** and then click **Run as administrator** under the **Command Prompt** option.
3. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:  
`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth`
4. It will scan your system image for any issues. Once the process is 100% complete, you may see **The component store is reparable** message if a problem is detected.
5. Next, run the following command and press Enter to repair the image. You may need an Internet connection to execute this command and download the necessary files.  
`DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth`
6. This process may take some time, so wait for it to complete.
7. Once the restore operation is complete, close the Command Prompt and restart your PC.
8. After the restart, check if your audio device is working.

## Fix the "No Audio Output Device Is Installed" Error

 When connected, Windows will detect all the audio input and output devices and install the necessary drivers automatically. To fix the no audio output device is installed error, make sure your audio device is enabled in the Sound settings.

 If the error is resolved, but the audio is still not working, make sure you have the right audio device set as default. Also, try to reinstall the affected driver, restart audio services, and check your audio device for hardware failure.

 Your Windows computer automatically detects all the connected audio devices and installs the necessary drivers to get the audio working. Sometimes, however, you may encounter the No Audio Output Device is installed error message when you hover your mouse over the audio icon in the system tray.

 This error occurs when Windows fails to detect your connected audio devices. It can be a temporary glitch, a driver-related issue, or, in some cases, caused by system file corruption. Here are a few troubleshooting steps to help you fix the No Audio Output Device installed error on Windows.
