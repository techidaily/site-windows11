## 2\. Perform a Power Cycle

 Sometimes, the most effective solution is surprisingly simple. Performing a power cycle can resolve various issues with your Windows PC caused by temporary glitches. To perform a power cycle:

1. Turn off your computer and unplug it from the power source.
2. Press and hold the **power button** for 30 to 60 seconds to drain all the power that’s left on your device.
3. Leave your computer idle for a few minutes.
4. Connect your computer to the power supply, and then turn it back on.

## 3\. Check the Quick Settings Panel

 The [Quick Settings panel in Windows 11](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-customize-quick-settings-menu/) provides access to various commonly used settings, including Bluetooth. If you can’t find the Bluetooth toggle in the Quick Settings panel, you might have removed it by mistake. Here’s how you can retrieve it.

1. Press **Win + A** to open the Quick Settings panel.
2. Click the **pencil icon** to edit the Quick Settings panel.

## 4\. Check Bluetooth Settings

 The Bluetooth icon may not appear on the taskbar or system tray if you have previously removed the icon. Here's how you can [pin the Bluetooth icon to the Windows taskbar](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-pin-bluetooth-icon-windows-10-taskbar/) again.

## 5\. Configure the Bluetooth Support Service

 Bluetooth Support Service is a small program that runs in the background to allow Bluetooth to function on Windows. Your Bluetooth issues could be because the service isn't running. Here’s how to fix it.

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
2. Type **services.msc** in the text field and press **Enter**.
3. Double-click on **Bluetooth Support Service** to open its properties.

![Bluetooth Support Service](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Bluetooth-Support-Service.jpg)

 Restart your PC one more time and check if the Bluetooth option appears.

## 6\. Update or Reinstall Your Bluetooth Drivers

 Malfunctioning or corrupt Bluetooth drivers on your PC could also be the source of the problem. If that seems to be the case, updating the Bluetooth driver should help.

1. Right-click on the **Start** icon and select **Device Manager** from the list.
2. Expand the **Bluetooth** section, right-click on the **Bluetooth adapter**, and select **Update driver**.
3. Select **Search automatically for drivers** and allow Windows to install the best available drivers.  
![Update Bluetooth Driver](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Update-Bluetooth-Driver.jpg)

 If the Bluetooth entry is missing from the Device Manager, visit your Bluetooth adapter manufacturer's website to download the driver and install it manually.

 If updating the driver does not help, you’ll have to reinstall the Bluetooth drivers. To do so, open the Device Manager again, right-click on the **Bluetooth driver**, and then select **Uninstall device**.

 Once removed, restart your PC. Windows should install the missing Bluetooth driver during boot, and the Bluetooth option should appear on your PC.

## 7\. Disable and Re-Enable the Problematic USB Driver

 Several users on a [Microsoft Community post](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-11-bluetooth-disappears-fixes-2023/34f5c8b1-b5a1-4323-a7f6-4513c733d731) reported restoring the missing Bluetooth functionality on their computers by disabling and re-enabling the USB drivers. You can also give it a go.

1. Open Device Manager using the search menu.
2. Expand **Universal Serial Bus controllers**.
3. Look for any entries with a yellow warning triangle. Right-click it and select **Disable device**.
4. Select **Yes** to confirm.
5. Right-click on the USB driver again and select **Enable device**.  
![Enable USB Driver Using Device Manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/enable-usb-driver-using-device-manager.jpg)

## 8\. Run SFC and DISM Scans

 Bluetooth issues can also arise if critical system files are missing from your computer. Windows includes a couple of [tools that can help you replace any missing or damaged system files](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/) with their cached version. Here’s how to run them.

1. Press **Win + X** and select **Terminal (Admin)** from the list.
2. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt shows up.
3. In the console, run the following command:

`sfc /scannow`

 Wait for the scan to complete, and then run the DISM (or Deployment Image Servicing and Management) scan.

`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`

![DISM Scan on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/DISM-Scan-on-Windows.jpg)

 After the scan is complete, restart your PC and check if the issue is still there.

## 9\. Boot into Safe Mode

 When you boot Windows into Safe Mode, it runs without any non-essential drivers and programs. This can help you verify if the issue is caused by a third-party driver or program running in the background.

 Windows 11 gives [several options for booting into Safe Mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-boot-safe-mode/). You can use any of your preferred methods to enter Safe Mode and see if the Bluetooth option appears. If it does, then a third-party program or service is to blame. In that case, you’ll have to remove any recently installed apps or programs to fix the issue.

## 2\. Perform a Power Cycle

 Sometimes, the most effective solution is surprisingly simple. Performing a power cycle can resolve various issues with your Windows PC caused by temporary glitches. To perform a power cycle:

1. Turn off your computer and unplug it from the power source.
2. Press and hold the **power button** for 30 to 60 seconds to drain all the power that’s left on your device.
3. Leave your computer idle for a few minutes.
4. Connect your computer to the power supply, and then turn it back on.

## 3\. Check the Quick Settings Panel

 The [Quick Settings panel in Windows 11](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-customize-quick-settings-menu/) provides access to various commonly used settings, including Bluetooth. If you can’t find the Bluetooth toggle in the Quick Settings panel, you might have removed it by mistake. Here’s how you can retrieve it.

1. Press **Win + A** to open the Quick Settings panel.
2. Click the **pencil icon** to edit the Quick Settings panel.
3. Click on **Add** and select **Bluetooth** from the list to add it to the panel.  
![Add Bluetooth to Quick Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Add-Bluetooth-to-Quick-Settings.jpg)

## 4\. Check Bluetooth Settings

 The Bluetooth icon may not appear on the taskbar or system tray if you have previously removed the icon. Here's how you can [pin the Bluetooth icon to the Windows taskbar](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-pin-bluetooth-icon-windows-10-taskbar/) again.

1. Open the **Start menu** and go to **Settings > Bluetooth & devices**.
2. Go to **Devices** and click on **More Bluetooth Settings**.
3. Tick the box that reads **Show the Bluetooth icon in the notification area**.
4. Hit **Apply,** followed by **OK**.

## 5\. Configure the Bluetooth Support Service

 Bluetooth Support Service is a small program that runs in the background to allow Bluetooth to function on Windows. Your Bluetooth issues could be because the service isn't running. Here’s how to fix it.

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
2. Type **services.msc** in the text field and press **Enter**.
3. Double-click on **Bluetooth Support Service** to open its properties.
4. Use the drop-down menu next to **Startup type** to select **Automatic**.
5. Hit **Apply** to save changes.  
![Bluetooth Support Service](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Bluetooth-Support-Service.jpg)

 Restart your PC one more time and check if the Bluetooth option appears.

## 6\. Update or Reinstall Your Bluetooth Drivers

 Malfunctioning or corrupt Bluetooth drivers on your PC could also be the source of the problem. If that seems to be the case, updating the Bluetooth driver should help.

1. Right-click on the **Start** icon and select **Device Manager** from the list.
2. Expand the **Bluetooth** section, right-click on the **Bluetooth adapter**, and select **Update driver**.
3. Select **Search automatically for drivers** and allow Windows to install the best available drivers.  
![Update Bluetooth Driver](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Update-Bluetooth-Driver.jpg)

 If the Bluetooth entry is missing from the Device Manager, visit your Bluetooth adapter manufacturer's website to download the driver and install it manually.

 If updating the driver does not help, you’ll have to reinstall the Bluetooth drivers. To do so, open the Device Manager again, right-click on the **Bluetooth driver**, and then select **Uninstall device**.

 Once removed, restart your PC. Windows should install the missing Bluetooth driver during boot, and the Bluetooth option should appear on your PC.

## 7\. Disable and Re-Enable the Problematic USB Driver

 Several users on a [Microsoft Community post](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-11-bluetooth-disappears-fixes-2023/34f5c8b1-b5a1-4323-a7f6-4513c733d731) reported restoring the missing Bluetooth functionality on their computers by disabling and re-enabling the USB drivers. You can also give it a go.

1. Open Device Manager using the search menu.
2. Expand **Universal Serial Bus controllers**.
3. Look for any entries with a yellow warning triangle. Right-click it and select **Disable device**.
4. Select **Yes** to confirm.
5. Right-click on the USB driver again and select **Enable device**.

## 8\. Run SFC and DISM Scans

 Bluetooth issues can also arise if critical system files are missing from your computer. Windows includes a couple of [tools that can help you replace any missing or damaged system files](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/) with their cached version. Here’s how to run them.

1. Press **Win + X** and select **Terminal (Admin)** from the list.
2. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt shows up.
3. In the console, run the following command:

`sfc /scannow`

 Wait for the scan to complete, and then run the DISM (or Deployment Image Servicing and Management) scan.

`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`

 After the scan is complete, restart your PC and check if the issue is still there.

## 9\. Boot into Safe Mode

 When you boot Windows into Safe Mode, it runs without any non-essential drivers and programs. This can help you verify if the issue is caused by a third-party driver or program running in the background.

 Windows 11 gives [several options for booting into Safe Mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-boot-safe-mode/). You can use any of your preferred methods to enter Safe Mode and see if the Bluetooth option appears. If it does, then a third-party program or service is to blame. In that case, you’ll have to remove any recently installed apps or programs to fix the issue.
