6. Click the drop-down for **Let this app run in background** and select **Never**. This should disable the app from running in the background.

 By default, the background permission for the app is set to **Power optimized(recommended)**. This means Windows will decide when the app can run in the background to save more power. If you set it to **Always**, the app will continuously run in the background irrespective of your power status.

## 3\. How to Disable Background Apps for the Current User

 If you want, you can disable background apps for the individual user. Useful if you share your PC with multiple users at work or home. Also useful if you need to disable a non-Microsoft third-party app from running in the background.

 For this, you will need to create a registry file and run it with administrative privilege. Before you proceed, [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/). You can use the restore point to revert your PC to its previous state if something goes wrong when editing the registry entries.

 To disable background apps for the current user:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the **Run** dialog.
2. Type **notepad** and click **OK** to open the text editor app.  
![disable background apps windows 11 registry editor](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/disable-background-apps-windows-11-registry-editor.jpg)
3. In the Notepad file, copy and paste the following content:  

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\BackgroundAccessApplications]  
"GlobalUserDisabled"=dword:00000001  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Search]  
"BackgroundAppGlobalToggle"=dword:00000000`
4. Next, press **Win + S** to open the **Save** dialog.
5. Here, name the file as **Disable\_Background\_Apps\_for\_current\_user.reg**. Then, click the **Save as type** drop-down and select **All Files.**  
![disable background apps windows 11 registry editor save](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/disable-background-apps-windows-11-registry-editor-save.jpg)
6. Click the **Save** button to save the file.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

7. Right-click on the newly created reg file and select **Open.** Click **Yes** to confirm and modify the registry entries to disable background apps.
8. If the script runs without error, restart your PC to apply the changes.

 The above script modifies the two DWORD values, **GlobalUserDisabled** and **BackgroundAppGlobalToggle,** setting them to **1** and **0**, respectively. Modifying the GlobalUserDisabled value prevents background access to applications.

 Similarly, changes to the BackgroundAppGlobalToggle turn off the toggle for background apps in Windows search, thus limiting its background access.

 If you need to turn on background apps for the current user, then save the following script as **enable\_background\_apps.reg** and run it as administrator.

![reg file content background app disable](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/reg-file-content-background-app-disable.png)

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\BackgroundAccessApplications]  
"GlobalUserDisabled"=-  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Search]  
"BackgroundAppGlobalToggle"=-`

## 4\. How to Disable Background Apps for All Users Using Registry Editor

 If you want to disable background apps for all the user accounts, you can manually create and modify the registry values in the Registry Editor.

 To disable background apps for all the user accounts:

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**.
2. Type **regedit**, and click **OK**. Click **Yes** to grant administrative access.
3. In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following location:  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows`
4. Under the **Windows** key, locate the **AppPrivacy** key**.** If not available, you will need to create a new key.  
![registry editor create new key](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/registry-editor-create-new-key.png)
5. Right-click on the **Windows** key and select **New > Key.** Rename the key as **AppPrivacy.**

6. Right-click on the **AppPrivacy** key and select **New > DWORD (32-bit) Value**. Rename the value as **LetAppsRunInBackground.**

If you are on Home, read our guide on [how to enable Group Policy Editor in Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/).

 Alternatively, you can set the Let Windows apps run in the background policy to **Disabled** and apply the changes. However, when set to **Disabled** or **Not Configured**, individual employees in your organization can configure the apps to run in the background.

 On the contrary, setting this policy to **Force Deny** will prevent the app from running in the background, with no option for the employees to change the policy.

 Windows allows you to configure background app permission for the Microsoft Store apps. You can disable these apps to conserve battery and avoid unnecessary data usage on a metered connection.

 That said, if you are struggling with slow system performance issues, disabling background apps may not be the solution. What you can do instead is reconfigure your OS, analyze your storage devices and look for hardware upgrades to boost system performance.

 Fortunately, Windows lets you change the background permission for individual Microsoft Store apps. Here we show you how to disable individual or all background apps in Windows 11\.
