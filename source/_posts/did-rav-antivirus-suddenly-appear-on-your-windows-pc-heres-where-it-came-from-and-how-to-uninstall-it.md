## Did RAV Antivirus Suddenly Appear on Your Windows PC? Here's Where It Came From & How to Uninstall It

 If you have RAV Antivirus running on your computer but don't remember installing it, it may have been installed along with another application. It sometimes gets bundled in with other apps, and you are more likely to experience this if you download a torrenting app.

 While RAV antivirus isn't bad by any means, sometimes you will accidentally install it without wanting it. Thus, if it's now on your computer and now you want to uninstall it, here's how.

## How to Remove RAV Antivirus on Windows

Follow the below steps to remove RAV Antivirus on Windows:

1. Right-click on the Windows**Start** button and select**Settings** .
2. On the left-sidebar, click**Apps** .
3. Click**Apps & Features** in the right-hand pane.
4. Under**App list** , search for**"RAV Antivirus."**
5. To uninstall the program, right-click on the**three vertical dots** next to its name and select**Uninstall** .

6. When the confirmation popup appears, click**Uninstall** .

 If you follow the above steps, you can uninstall RAV Antivirus successfully. However, if, for some reason, you are not able to locate RAV Antivirus in the apps list, then you will have to uninstall it via the Control Panel. Here's how to do it:
