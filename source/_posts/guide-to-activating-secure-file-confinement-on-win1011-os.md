## How to Set Controlled Folder Access Exceptions

 The problem with controlled folder access is that it can stop legitimate apps from accessing required files when they need to. That can be an especially big issue for Windows gaming since untrusted games often can’t save progress with controlled folder access enabled. In-game settings can also reset when that feature is turned on.

 Fortunately, controlled folder access has an exclusion (exception) list for adding trusted apps. It won’t block any trusted apps on that list from modifying files within protected folders. You can add software to the CFA exclusion list as follows:

1. Bring up the**Controlled folder access** setting in Windows Security as covered in steps one to three of the first method above.
2. Click the **Allow an app through Controlled folder access navigation** link.
3. Press the**\+ Add an allowed app** button.  
![The Add an allowed app button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/add-an-allowed-app.jpg)
4. Click**Browse all** **apps** on the menu that appears.

## Enable Controlled Folder Access for Greater Ransomware Protection

 Turning on controlled folder access in Windows 10 and 11 with the above methods will give files on your PC an extra layer of protection from malware. It makes little difference how you enable that feature, but you can select more configuration options by using Group Policy Editor. Adding controlled folder access context menu settings also gives you a more direct way to toggle that feature on/off as required.
