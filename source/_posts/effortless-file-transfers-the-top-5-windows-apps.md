## Effortless File Transfers: The Top 5 Windows Apps

 While you can always use a USB drive to move your files around, there are now many Windows apps out there that will help you do the same with just a few clicks. So, how do you pick the best one?

 Like anything else, what’s best for you depends on what you want. This stands true in the case of file-sharing apps as well. We’ve rounded up various file-sharing tools that you can use for sharing your files on a Windows PC with ease.

[Windows OneDrive](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-onedrive/) is a cloud storage tool from Microsoft that you can use to store your Windows files and other important documents. Even though the first thing that springs to mind when people hear OneDrive is a way to[back up your data on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ultimate-windows-10-data-backup-guide/) , online cloud storage tools work very well in transferring your files from one device to another as well.

 All you have to do is upload the files to your cloud storage. From there, you can then download the files from any device after logging in to your account. Of course, OneDrive is only one of the many cloud services tools. There are other options that will work just as well, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.

 OneDrive offers a free plan with a limit of 5GB of storage place. If you like the app, you can decide from a list of subscription plans.
