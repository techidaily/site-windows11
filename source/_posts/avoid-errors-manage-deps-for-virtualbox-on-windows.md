## Avoid Errors: Manage Deps for VirtualBox on Windows

 VirtualBox is a virtualization platform that allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single computer. It's installation on Windows requires a couple of packages available upfront. Without meeting these dependencies, VirtualBox installation will end up with an error.

 Visual C++ Redistributable is a straightforward installation, it is not the same case with Python as it requires configuring as well. The good thing is it is easy to do.

## Dependencies for Installation of VirtualBox on Windows

 VirtualBox is a cross-platform software. Apart from Windows, you can [install VirtualBox on Linux](https://www.makeuseof.com/install-ubuntu-virtualbox/) and Mac as well. The installation package is available for download from the official [VirtualBox site](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

 Before you install VirtualBox, you must install these packages:

* Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 Redistributable Package
* Python core / win32ap

 If they are not installed already, VirtualBox will ask you during installation to set them up first. See the following images for reference:
