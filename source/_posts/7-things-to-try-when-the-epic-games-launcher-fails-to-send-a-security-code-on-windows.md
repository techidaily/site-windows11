## 7 Things to Try When the Epic Games Launcher Fails to Send a Security Code on Windows

 Epic Games Launcher is the go-to place to download some of the most popular games like GTA 5, Fall Guys, Rocket League, and more. However, for many users, the launcher fails to send the security code necessary for account verification. This issue can be frustrating as it prevents users from playing games downloaded to their account.

 As such, if Epic Games Launcher fails to send the security code, then try the below fixes to troubleshoot the problem for good.

## 1\. Check Your Login Credentials

 Oftentimes, users enter incorrect login credentials and start wondering why they haven't received the security code in their inbox. Thus, make sure you are entering the correct username and password and that your caps lock key is not on. You may also reset your password if unsure if it is correct.

## 2\. Check Your Internet Connection

 You must be connected to a stable and reliable internet connection to receive the security code in your inbox. To check your internet stability and speed, use an [internet speed testing website](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/) .

## 3\. Is the Epic Games Server Down?

 Epic Games Launcher might fail to send the security code if its server is under maintenance or facing downtime. To confirm if that's what is causing the issue, visit [Epic Games Launcher server status website](https://status.epicgames.com/) . Alternatively, you check [Epic Games Launcher Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/EpicGames) to know about any ongoing server issues.

 If servers are under maintenance or facing downtime, you can't do much other than wait until they become operational again.

## 4\. Disable Your VPN

 VPN allows you to access all those websites that are blocked in your area. But a VPN connection can also make your connection unstable and stop the Epic Games Launcher from sending the security code.

So, disable any active VPN and check if it fixes the issue.

## 5\. Switch to a Google Public DNS
