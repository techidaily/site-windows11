## Preventing Search Bar Autonomy in Windows 11 Interface

 Is the Search menu keep opening by itself? When this happens, it automatically interrupts your activity, so it can be very annoying. The problem is due to several reasons, from a misconfigured peripheral device to corrupted system files.

 Let’s take a closer look at how you can fix the Search menu if it keeps popping up.

## 1\. Check the Windows Key

 Windows is set to launch the Search menu if you press the **Windows** key. The Search menu might keep opening if you accidentally it, or if the key somehow got stuck.

 If there’s nothing blocking the key, you can [change the keyboard layout](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-add-change-keyboard-layouts/) to avoid opening the Search menu by mistake.

## 2\. Unplug Any Peripheral Devices

 There’s a chance that one of your connected devices is interfering and keeps opening the Windows Search menu. For example, a joystick might open the Search menu if you accidentally press one of its buttons.

 Unplug the devices one by one and check if this fixes the issue. Once you identify the problematic device, you can keep it unplugged, disable it through Device Manager, or launch its app and configure the settings.

 The same goes for your Bluetooth devices. If you have a hard time keeping track of them, you could [rename Bluetooth devices on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-rename-bluetooth-devices/).

## 3\. Check Your Laptop Touchpad Gestures

 There’s a chance there’s nothing wrong with your computer, but you keep opening the Search menu without knowing it. By default, Windows is launching the Search menu if you tap the laptop’s touchpad with three fingers.

 Here’s how you can adjust Windows touchpad gestures to stop opening the Search menu:

1. Press **Win + I** to launch Settings.
2. Head to **Bluetooth & devices > Touchpad**.
3. Extend the **Three-finger gestures** list.
4. Change **Taps** to **Nothing**.

## 4\. Run the Search and Indexing Troubleshooter

 While search and indexing issues are not that common, Windows still has a dedicated troubleshooter you can use whenever running into an issue. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Press **Win + I** to launch Windows Settings.
2. Go to **System > Troubleshoot > Other Troubleshooters**.
3. Click the **Run** button next to **Search and indexing**.  
![Run the search and index troubleshooter in Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/search-troubleshooter-1.jpg)

 Follow the on-screen instructions and allow the troubleshooter to fix any detected problem. If the Search and Indexing troubleshooter wasn’t enough to solve the issue, move on to the next solution.

## 5\. Close the SearchHost Process

 Whenever you open Windows Search menu, the SearchHost.exe process starts running. Usually, the process automatically stops when you close the Search menu. But if the menu keeps popping up, it might be a sign the process is still running. In this case, you should restart it.

 Launch Task Manager by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + Esc**. Then, select the **Details** tab and search for **SearchHost.exe**. Right-click the process, select **End task**, and confirm the action in the pop-up window.

## 6\. Run an SFC Scan

 If the Search menu is still opening by itself after ending its process, you should [run an SFC scan](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/). This way, you can check for any bug within the system files and have Windows fix the problem for you.

## 7\. Check Windows Services

 Windows Search is a service that runs in the background and takes care of search results for files, property caching, and indexing. So, if you’re facing an issue with the Windows Search menu, you should restart its service.

 Press **Win + R** to bring up a Run dialog, type **services,** and click **OK**. In the Services window, locate and open **Windows Search**. Click **Stop > Start** to restart the service.

 Reboot your system and check if the problem is now solved.
