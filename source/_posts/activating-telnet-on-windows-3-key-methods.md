## Activating Telnet on Windows: 3 Key Methods

 Despite the vulnerability issues, Telnet is still used as a client-server protocol by Windows users. It is primarily used for initial network hardware configuration, remote access, port testing and forwarding, and other tasks that don't involve sensitive information transfer.

 You can enable Telnet on Windows 10 and 11 computers via Command Prompt or the Graphics User Interface (GUI) tool. Here we show you the many ways to enable Telnet on your Windows computer.

## 1\. Enable Telnet on Windows Using Control Panel

 You can enable Telnet Client using the Classic Control Panel. Since it is an optional feature, you can enable it using the Windows Optional Feature dialog. You can use it [add or remove other users' optional features on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-remove-optional-features-windows-11/) .

To enable Telnet Client using Control Panel:

1. Press**Win + R** to open**Run** .

 You can use the Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature cmdlet to enable Telnet Client using Windows PowerShell. Useful if you are unable to turn on the feature using the Windows Features dialog and it is also faster than the GUI method.

To enable Telnet using Windows PowerShell:

1. Press**Win + X** to open the**WinX** menu.

`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName TelnetClient`
4. This process may take several minutes, so wait for it to complete and return a status report. If successful, youâ€™ll see the result as**Online:True.**
5. If you want to disable Telnet Client, use the following command instead:  
`Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName TelnetClient`
6. Close PowerShell and restart your PC.

## 3\. Install Telnet Client Using Command Prompt

Follow these steps to install Telnet using Command Prompt:

1. Press the**Win** key and type**cmd** .
2. Right-click on**Command Prompt** and select**Run as administrator.**
3. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press**Enter** :  
`dism /online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:TelnetClient`

2. In the Command Prompt window, type**Telnet** and press**Enter** .

## All the Ways to Enable Telnet On Your Windows 11 Computer

 Telnet is a built-in remote access utility that you can use to troubleshoot firewall and network issues. While it is still part of Windows, system administrators now prefer the more secure SSH protocol to access computers over an unsecured network.

 The major disadvantage of Telnet is that it is not secure and prone to a man-in-the-middle attack. If not for particular situations, switch to a more secure network protocol such as SSH and Mosh with better password and public key authentication.
