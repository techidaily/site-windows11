## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 This particular error occurs when the update being installed is incompatible with the device running it, or when the download times out due to network-related issues. So before you try any of the other solutions, it’s a good idea to restart your computer and see if it fixes the issue.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Open the Start menu.
2. Click on the**Power** icon.
3. Then select**Shutdown** from the menu options.
4. Wait a few minutes before turning your computer back on again.

 Once you have done this, launch Windows Update again and attempt to install any updates that are currently available for download. If the error persists after restarting your computer, try the other solutions given below.

## 2\. Use the Windows Update Troubleshooter

 If restarting the computer doesn't solve the issue, you may want to run the Windows Update Troubleshooter, a program that can detect and fix any problems with Windows updates. Here's how to do it:

1. Press**Win + I** on your keyboard to open System Settings (see[how to open System Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) for more methods).
2. From the left side of the screen, select**System** .
3. You can then choose**Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters** .

## 3\. Check Your Internet Connection

 Another potential cause of error 0x8024a205 is a poor or unstable internet connection. Make sure that your internet connection is stable and working properly, then try running Windows Update again.

## 4\. Disable or Remove Any Antivirus Programs

 Antivirus programs are essential for protecting your computer and personal data, but sometimes they can conflict with Windows Update and cause unwanted problems. If the error still continues to appear, you can try disabling or uninstalling any antivirus software that is installed on your computer.

 If you use Windows Defender, you won't be able to uninstall it. However, you can learn[how to turn off Windows Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-off-windows-defender/) and try that. Third-party antivirus programs usually come with documentation on how to disable them, so follow the steps included and be sure to re-enable the antivirus afterward regardless of the result.

 Otherwise, to remove a third-party antivirus program from your computer, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on**Start** and select**Installed apps** .
2. From there, search for the application you want to uninstall.
3. When you find it, click on the three dots and select the**Uninstall** option.
4. Again click**Uninstall** to confirm it then follow the onscreen instructions.

 Once done, restart your computer to ensure any remaining elements of the antivirus have been removed.
