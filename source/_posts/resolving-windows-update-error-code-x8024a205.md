 Another potential cause of error 0x8024a205 is a poor or unstable internet connection. Make sure that your internet connection is stable and working properly, then try running Windows Update again.

## 4\. Disable or Remove Any Antivirus Programs

 Antivirus programs are essential for protecting your computer and personal data, but sometimes they can conflict with Windows Update and cause unwanted problems.

2. From there, search for the application you want to uninstall.
3. When you find it, click on the three dots and select the**Uninstall** option.

 Once done, restart your computer to ensure any remaining elements of the antivirus have been removed.
