 Users have reported a 0x80072EFD Microsoft Store error on support forums that can arise in Windows 11 or 10\.

 The 0x80072EFD error is often a connection-related one. However, it occurs even when users can surf the web in their browsers. If you need to fix the 0x80072EFD error, try fixing it with these potential resolutions.

## 1\. Run the Windows Store App Troubleshooter

You can clear that cache in Settings, as covered in our [guide for resetting apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-reset-app/) in Windows 11 and Windows 10.

1. Start the Run dialogue by pressing**Win** +**R** .
2. Type**inetcpl.cpl** inside Run's command box and click**OK** to open Internet Options.

## 5\. Double-Check the Time Settings in Windows

 An incorrect region time on your PC is another potential cause for error 0x80072EFD. Users have confirmed they've fixed error 0x80072EF by adjusting time settings on their PCs. The Microsoft Store's time tracking needs to sync with the PC's set regional time. So, have a look through your time settings as follows:

1. [Open up Settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) , and click that app's**Time & language** tab.
2. Click**Date & time** to view those settings.

5. Click**Apply** to set the protocol options.
6. Select**OK** to exit the Internet Options window.

## 7\. Reregister Microsoft Store

 You can't reinstall Microsoft Store like other apps. However, reregistering it with PowerShell is similar to reinstalling. If other potential solutions don't fix the 0x80072EFD error, reregistering MS Store is worth a try. This is how you can register that app:

1. Activate the**Type here to search** box with that tool's**Windows** +**S** hotkey.
2. Enter**PowerShell** within that tool's search box.
3. Launch Windows PowerShell with elevated permissions by clicking that search result's**Run as administrator** option.
4. Input this command for reregistering MS Store and hit**Return** to execute:  
`Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers *WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}`  
![The reregister MS Store command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/reregister-ms-store-command.jpg)
5. Wait until you're sure the command has finished.
6. Then exit PowerShell, and select the**Restart** option.

## 8\. Reset Your Network
