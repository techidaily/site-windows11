## Bypassing Printer Usage Errors Efficiently

 Printing documents and images is essential for many users. However, some users’ printers don’t print because of a Windows error message that says, “Another computer is using the printer.” Users have reported this error message appears when they select to print in Windows software packages.

 This error message suggests the printer can’t print because it’s already in use by another computer. However, the error also arises for home users who aren’t sharing their printers with other computers on organization networks. This is how you can fix the “Another computer is using the printer” error on Windows 10 & 11\.

## 1\. Restart the Printer

 Restarting the printer is a simple possible fix that’s worth a try. The printer could be stuck with a preceding request, which applying this solution might resolve. So, power off your printer for a few minutes and then turn it back on to see if that makes a difference.

## 2\. Deselect the "Allow Windows to Manage My Default Printer" Option

 The **Allow Windows to manage my default printer** option sets the most recently used printer to be the default one when enabled. This can cause issues if the printer with which you’re trying to print isn’t set as default. You can turn off that setting as follows:

1. Right-click the button for opening the Start menu to select **Search**.
2. Type **printers & scanners** inside the search utility.
3. Select **Printers & scanners** to open that Settings section.
4. Turn off the **Allow Windows to manage my default printer** setting by clicking that option’s toggle switch.

5. Then select your printer in Setting to click its **Set as default** button.

 You might see an alternative WS printer listed in Settings (most typically for Canon models). The WS stands for web services, and that printer shouldn’t be your default one. Make sure your standard printer is set as default.

So, that troubleshooter could feasibly offer a solution for the “Another computer is using the printer” error. This [how to run any troubleshooter post](https://www.makeuseof.com/run-troubleshooter-windows-10-11/) explains how you can access that troubleshooter in the Windows 11/10 Settings app.
