## Navigating the Landscape of Android & Windows File Sharing

 Previously, you could only use Google's Nearby Share feature to share files between Android devices and Chromebooks. However, this has changed with Google's release of Nearby Share Beta for Windows. With it, you can seamlessly exchange photos, videos, documents, and more between Android phones and Windows PCs.

 Let's see how you can use Google’s Nearby Share app to transfer files between Android devices and Windows computers.

## What You Need to Share Files Between Android and Windows Using Nearby Share

 Before we get started, let’s go over some prerequisites for exchanging files via Google’s Nearby Share app for Windows.

* Your computer must have a**64-bit version of Windows 10 or up** . ARM-powered Windows devices are not supported at the moment. If you're unsure which version your PC is using, be sure to read [how to tell if your Windows is 32 or 64-bit](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-easy-ways-to-know-if-youre-on-a-64-bit-version-of-windows/) .
* Your Android phone must be running**Android 6.0 or higher** . Not sure which version your phone is on? Check out [how to tell which version of Android you have](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-version-of-android/) and find out.
* Both devices should have**Bluetooth** and**Wi-Fi** turned on.
* Both devices should be connected to the same Wi-Fi network and within**16 feet (5 meters)** of each other.
* Google’s Nearby Share app for Windows is available in most parts of the world except for a few European countries. You can check if your country is supported via [Google Support](https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/13470053) , under "availability."

## How to Download and Set Up Google’s Nearby Share App on Windows

 To exchange files between your Android phone and Windows PC, you’ll first need to install and set up Google’s Nearby Share app on your computer. Here’s how you can go about it.

1. Download [Google’s Nearby Share Beta for Windows](https://android.com/better-together/nearby-share-app/) .
2. Double-click the**BetterTogetherSetup.exe** file to begin the installation.
3. Once the Nearby Share app is installed, click the**Sign in** button to link your Google account. If you don't want to do that, click**Use without an account** instead.
4. Under**Visible to others as** , enter a name for your device.
5. Under**Receiving** , specify who is allowed to share files with your computer:**Everyone** ,**Contacts** ,**Your devices** , or**No one** .
6. Click**Done** .

## Sharing Made Simple With Nearby Share on Android

 Sharing files between Android and Windows used to be a cumbersome process with no straightforward way to do it. Thankfully, all of that has changed with Google’s Nearby Share app for Windows.

 If you are looking for more functionality, however, you can use Microsoft’s Phone Link app to access your phone’s contacts, messages, call logs, photos, and more on your Windows PC.
