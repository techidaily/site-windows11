 This will bring up the Microsoft Family Safety website. Click the**Sign in to Family Safety** and enter your Microsoft account credentials. There you’ll see every account connected to your Microsoft account, including your child’s account.

 To manage your child’s account, you’ll have to connect it to a device. If you want to connect it to your computer, sign in using its credentials.

 Now, head back to the Family Safety webpage as shown before, and click your child’s account. In the left pane, you can see the categories for setting and changing permissions.
