## Easy Mouse Customization Tips for Win11's Pointer Accessibility

 A mouse pointer is like your digital hand; it lets you see the cursor’s position on your screen and helps you control elements through your PC’s mouse or touchpad. In addition, the mouse pointer indicates where you can input, select and highlight text on your computer.

 Enhancing your mouse pointer changes how you interact with your computer by improving your productivity with tasks. Luckily, Windows 11 features some accessibility options through which you can configure your cursor to what works best for you.

## How to Customize Your Mouse Pointer

 The mouse pointer is an integral part of computing, and you perform many functions on your computer through it. You can select, point, and execute programs on your computer by moving and clicking the mouse pointer.

 It changes form depending on where it is placed; when hovered over editable text, it changes to a text cursor. Meanwhile, it changes to a hand when you hover over a link and opens up the web page when clicked.

 For a tool that is responsible for most operations on your computer, it’s crucial that your mouse pointer is made as accessible and efficient as possible. And, on your Windows PC, there are a number of customization options to help you achieve this.

So, without further ado, let’s get into them.

### 1\. Choosing Your Mouse Pointer Style

### 4\. Changing Your Primary Mouse Button

 The left mouse button is the default primary mouse button, typically used to activate or select on-screen elements. It is used for clicking, double-clicking, and drag-and-drop actions. On the other hand, the right mouse button is mostly used to open up a context menu, which provides more information on the selected item.

 The default setting might be convenient enough for right-handers since they can access the primary mouse button with their right index finger easily. But it might be uncomfortable for left-handed users. Or it could be that you simply prefer it the other way around.

 Windows 11 provides quick settings to switch the functions of both buttons. So, you don't have to stick with the default primary and secondary mouse positions. To do so, simply go to**Settings > Bluetooth & devices.**

 Click on**Mouse** and navigate to the**Primary Mouse Button** drop-down menu. You can switch your primary mouse button to either**Left or Right.**

 From the**Pointer Options** tab, you can select a pointer speed and**Enhance pointer precision** with the checkbox. If you’d like the pointer to move to its default in a dialogue box, click**Snap To.**

 Under**Visibility** , you can choose if you want your pointer to display trails, hide the pointer while typing, or show the location of the pointer when the Control key is clicked.

 Hit**Apply** afterward to implement your changes.

## How to Customize Your Text Cursor

 The text cursor is that blinking vertical line that indicates the point where you can enter or highlight text on your screen. The following settings show you how to enhance the look of your text cursor.
