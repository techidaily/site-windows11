## Overcoming No Audio Capture in OBS on Windows 11 PCs

 OBS Studio is a free-to-use app that allows you to record gameplay and stream online. However, like any other application, it has its own share of flaws. Many users have reported that OBS Studio fails to record audio on their Windows 11 PC.

 Luckily, it's a very common issue and can quickly be resolved. Here are all the working solutions that will help you fix OBS Studio if it is unable to record audio.

## 1\. Restart OBS Studio

 Before getting into advanced troubleshooting, consider restarting OBS Studio. The best way is to[launch the Task Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-device-manager/) and close all the OBS Studio-related processes.

 Next, relaunch the OBS Studio and check if it is able to record audio. If not, it's time for some more complicated fixes.

## 2\. Launch OBS Studio With Administrative Rights

 Oftentimes, issues in third-party applications occur due to a lack of administrative privileges. It can happen even when you're using an administrator account on your computer.

 The best way to resolve this problem is to configure OBS Studio to always launch as an administrator. To do that, follow the below steps:

1. Right-click on the OBS Studio icon and choose**Properties** from the context menu.
2. In the Properties window, switch to the**Compatibility** tab.
3. Check the**Run this program as an administrator** option.

4. Click**Apply** \>**OK** to save the settings.

## 3\. Unmute OBS Studio in the Settings App

 OBS Studio will fail to record audio if it is muted in the Settings app. Here's how to check and change OBS Studio sound settings in the Settings app.

1. Open the**Settings** app (see how to[launch the Settings app on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) ) and choose**System** from the left sidebar.
2. Select**Sound** from the right pane.
3. Under the**Advanced section,** choose the**Volume Mixer** option.
4. Under the**Apps section,** unmute OBS Studio if muted and adjust the slider accordingly.

Restart OBS Studio and check if the problem persists.

## 4\. Use the Correct Recording Device

 Windows allows you to manually choose recording and playback devices. But if you've chosen an incorrect recording device in Settings, then you're likely to face this issue. To fix this, you will have to configure the correct device as the default recording option. Here's how to do that:

1. Open the**Settings** app, and head towards**System** \>**Sound.**
2. Choose**More sound settings** under the**Advanced section.**
3. Switch to the**Recording** tab.
4. Right-click on the correct recording device and choose the**Set as Default Device** option from the context menu.  
![Set as default option in Sound properties](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/set-as-default-option.jpg)
5. Click**Apply** and then**OK.**

## 5\. Allow OBS Studio to Access Microphone

[Windows 11 is big on privacy and security](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-privacy-options-explained/) . The OS lets you allow or restrict apps from accessing certain services of your computer. For instance, you can restrict apps from using the microphone on your computer.

 As such, if you've mistakenly restricted OBS Studio from accessing the microphone, then you'll face audio issues. The solution here is to allow OBS Studio to access the microphone. Here's how:

1. Open the Settings app and choose**Privacy & Security** from the left sidebar.
2. Under the**App permission** section, select the**Microphone** option.
3. Enable the toggle next to the**Microphone access** option.

## 6\. Change the OBS Studio Settings

 OBS Studio lets you manually set audio devices and adjust their settings as per your preference. However, OBS Studio will be unable to record audio if you have chosen an incorrect audio device within its settings.

 So, head toward the OBS Studio audio settings, and choose the correct audio device to solve the issue. Here are the steps to do it:

1. Launch OBS Studio and choose**File** from the top-left corner.
2. Choose**Settings** from the context menu.
3. In the Settings window, select**Audio** from the left sidebar.
4. Under the**Global Audio Devices** section, click the drop-down icon next to**Desktop Audio** and**Desktop Audio 2** and choose**Default** in both options.
5. Next, click the drop-down icon next to**Mic/Auxiliary Audio** and**Mic/Auxiliary Audio 2** and choose**Default** in both options.

## 8\. Download the Latest Audio Driver Updates

 A corrupt or outdated audio driver can also be a prime reason why OBS Studio is unable to record audio. To fix this, you will have to[update the audio driver on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-update-audio-drivers-windows-11/) .

You can do that by following the below steps:

4. Choose**Search automatically for drivers** option in the window that crops up.

 Next, allow Windows to search for and download any available driver updates for your recording device.

## 9\. Reinstall OBS Studio
