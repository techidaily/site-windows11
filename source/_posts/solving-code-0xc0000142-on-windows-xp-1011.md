## Solving Code 0XC0000142 on Windows XP, 10/11

 Error 0xc0000142 occurs when users try launching some Windows software packages. Those who encountered this issue usually see an error message that says, "The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000142)." When that happens, the affected program refuses to launch.

 Unfortunately, error 0xc0000142 is a generic code that could affect many Windows software packages. However, many users report that it usually comes from Microsoft Office applications and games.

 So, if you're running into this issue, this is how you can fix error 0xc0000142 in Windows 11 and 10\.

## 1\. Run Affected Software With Admin Permissions

 Start your error 0xc0000142 troubleshooting by setting the affected software to run as an administrator. That will ensure the program can access more restricted file locations. You could potentially stop this error code by [setting the affected app to always run as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/always-run-apps-administrator-windows/).

## 2\. Set Affected Software to Run in Compatibility Mode

 If error 0xc0000142 arises for older software, there could be a compatibility issue with your PC's Windows 11/10 platform. Setting up an app or game to run in compatibility mode for an older Windows platform could resolve such an issue.

 This is how you can set your software to run in compatibility mode:

1. Press the **Windows** logo + **E** keyboard buttons and open the installation folder for your affected software.
2. Right-click the software's EXE (application) file to select **Properties**.  
![The Properties option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/the-properties-option.jpg)
3. Click on the properties window's **Compatibility** tab.
4. Select the checkbox labeled **Run this program in compatibility mode**.  
![Run this program as an administrator checkbox](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/run-this-program-in-compatibility-mode-checkbox.jpg)
5. Choose the Windows OS that was the latest one in your software's release year within the drop-down menu. Selecting Windows 8 or 7 there will probably be sufficient for most apps.
6. Click **Apply** to set the new compatibility mode.
7. Select **OK** to exit the properties window.

 An alternative method is to [use the Windows 11 Program Compatibility Troubleshooter](https://www.makeuseof.com/program-compatibility-troubleshooter-windows-11-guide/). That tool automatically applies recommended compatibility settings, saving you time and effort.
