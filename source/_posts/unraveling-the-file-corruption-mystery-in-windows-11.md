## 4\. Turn Off Real-Time Antivirus Shields

![The Real-time protection option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/real-time-protection-option.jpg)

 If you don’t have third-party security software, turn off Windows Security’s real-time antivirus shield, as covered in our article about [disabling Microsoft Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/permanently-disable-microsoft-defender-windows-11/). .

 Users with third-party antivirus utilities will need to turn off their antivirus shields via the apps’ system tray context menus. Right-click the antivirus app’s icon in the system tray and select a disable or turn off shield protection setting.
