## How to Add Widgets to the Windows 11 Desktop

 By hitting**Win + W** in Windows 11, you can bring up the widgets board. You can also do the same by hovering over the**Widgets button** on the left side of the**Taskbar** . On the board, you can add or remove widgets and even customize and rearrange them however you like, but you can’t add them to your desktop.

 Luckily, Windows has a third-party app called Widget Launcher that allows you to pin widgets to the desktop. Here’s how to use it.

## How to Download Widget Launcher

 Widget Launcher is available on the Microsoft Store. If you haven't explored it before,[the Microsoft Store has plenty of award-winning and innovative apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-store-award-winning-apps-customize/) . For the time being, we'll use it to download Widget Launcher.

Just click**Get in Store app** and Windows will handle the rest.

 Otherwise, press**Win + S** to open Windows Search and type**store** in the search box. Under**Best match** in the search results, click on**Microsoft Store** to launch the app. Search for**widget launcher** and install the app that appears.

## How to Add Widgets to Your Desktop With Widget Launcher

 With Widget Launcher open, you’ll see a list of all the available widgets, such as**Weather** ,**Clock** ,**Calendar** ,**Notes** , and**CPU Meter** , in the middle panel. Click on the widget you want to add to the desktop.

 In the right panel, click on**Launch Widget** , and the widget will now appear on your desktop. If you decide these widgets are enough for your needs, you can [disable Windows 11’s widgets](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-widgets/) .

 Some widgets, such as**Weather** ,**RSS Feed** , and**Slideshow** , will be blank when you first launch them. That’s because you need to tell them where to get the data they need to display.

 Let's take the**RSS Feed** widget, for example. To make it show the feeds you want, start by hovering over the widget and clicking on the**gear icon** in the small panel that appears on the right to open**Settings** .

![a blank rss feed widget in the Windows 11 desktop](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rss-fee-widget-windows-11-no-data.jpg)

 Then, enter the URL to the website the**RSS Feed** widget will use to populate itself with feeds, and then click**OK** . Now the widget won't be blank anymore.

 If this was the**Weather** widget, you'd need to add a location. And if it was the**Slideshow** widget, it would require a folder to find the images to display.

## How to Enable "Widgets Always on Top" Mode

 If you want to see the widgets every time no matter what window you’re on, click**Settings** in the bottom left corner of the Widget Launcher app. Then, turn on the toggle for**Widgets Always on Top** .

![the settings of the widget launcher in Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/widget-launcher-settings-always-top.jpg)

 By default, Widget Launcher is set to launch the widgets during startup as well. You can prevent this by setting the toggle for**Launch on Startup** to**Off** .
