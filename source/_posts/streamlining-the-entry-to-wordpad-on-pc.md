## Streamlining the Entry to WordPad on PC

 WordPad is a basic word-processing program that comes installed on most Windows PCs. The program allows you to create and edit documents, but it lacks some of the more advanced features of other word-editing applications. Despite its limited features, WordPad can be a helpful tool for quickly creating and editing simple documents.

 If you're new to Windows, you may not know how to open WordPad. Here are some quick and easy ways to launch WordPad on your Windows PC.

## 1\. How to Open WordPad Using the Windows Search Tool

 If you're not sure how to open WordPad on your Windows PC, don't worry! You can easily find and launch the program using the Windows Search tool.

To open WordPad using the search tool, follow these steps:

1. Head to the Start menu and search for "WordPad."

2. You should see the WordPad program pop up in the results. Simply click on it to launch the program.

 When you open WordPad, you can start typing or pasting text and use the ribbon interface to access formatting options.

## 2\. How to Open WordPad via File Explorer

 You can also use Windows File Explorer to access some useful programs installed on your Windows PC. To open WordPad using Windows Explorer, follow these steps:

1. Open Windows File Explorer (see[how to open File Explorer on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) ).
2. In the address bar, type the following and press**Enter** :  
`C:\Program Files\Windows NT\Accessories\wordpad.exe`

The WordPad application will open on your computer.

## 3\. How to Open WordPad Using the Run Dialog

 If you're looking for a quick way to open WordPad on your Windows PC, the Run dialog is the way to go. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

The WordPad application will now launch.

## 4\. How to Open WordPad Using the Task Manager

 Task Manager is a built-in application on Windows that provides users with information about the processes and programs running on their computers. It's not only useful for monitoring a computer's performance and ending unresponsive applications, but you can also launch Windows programs by using it.

 The Task Manager has a "Run new task" feature that lets you run WordPad without having to go to the Windows Start menu. When the Start menu isn't working or if you want to launch a program with different settings than the default, this is an option you might find helpful.

 The following steps will guide you through opening WordPad using the Task Manager:

1. Right-click on the Taskbar and select**Task Manager** from the menu that appears. You can also press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** on your keyboard to access the tool directly.
2. On the top bar, click**Run new task** in the "Processes" tab.
