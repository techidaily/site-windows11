`Shutdown /s -t 300`
5. The above command will trigger the Windows logoff action and shutdown your PC after 5 minutes.
6. If you want to perform a scheduled restart, type the following command and press Enter:  
`Shutdown -r -t Nseconds`
7. In the above command, replace **Nseconds** with the number of seconds to set a timer for a restart.
