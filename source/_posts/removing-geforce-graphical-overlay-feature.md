## Why Should You Remove the Nvidia GeForce Overlay?

 The Nvidia GeForce overlay has its fair share of problems. These include jittery game detection, problematic behavior with full-screen apps, and more. If you face any of these problems, it is advisable to remove the Nvidia GeForce Experience app to see if it fixes the problem.

## Does the Nvidia GeForce Overlay Impact System Performance?

 The Nvidia GeForce Experience app does not consume a lot of system resources. The official system requirements include a two-core processor and a GTX 600 series GPU.

 If the FPS drops are minuscule, you can ignore them. Otherwise, disabling the overlay or removing the Nvidia GeForce Experience app can help squeeze a few more frames from your games.

 Nvidia GeForce Experience isn't a bad app. It is a handy tool for automatically optimizing your games. But it depends upon your use case and whether you need the overlays feature or not. If you rarely use the GeForce overly, you can either disable it from within the app's settings or uninstall the program from your PC.
