## Rediscover the Lost Treasures Within Windows 11'S Features

 Windows 11 has been around for some time, and yet there are still some hidden gems within the system that people aren't using as much as they could. There are probably a few features of Microsoft’s latest operating system that you should familiarize yourself with to make the most of it.

 Microsoft, it seems, is taking its operating system into the future with productivity-focused fluid design features in line with the latest tech. These are some of Windows 11’s capabilities you might not be using to their fullest.

## Windows 11 Features You Ought to Familiarize Yourself With

 Here are a few features of Windows 11 we think you should know about and use more often:

### 1\. Get Familiar With Snap Layouts

 This is one of the most effective ways to boost your productivity in Windows 11, and frankly, everyone should be using this neat feature. Microsoft introduced a new set of layout options to snap windows side-by-side or in a tiled format on your screen. This tool is so powerful and simple to use—it’s built into the OS—that it seems obvious Microsoft will expand on it in the next iteration of their desktop operating system.

![windows 11 snap layouts three windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/windows-11-snap-layouts-three-windows.jpg)

 We’ve covered [how to use Snap Layouts in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-snap-layouts-in-windows-11/) in a separate article that also explains customizing them to best suit how you work.

### 2\. Use Widgets to Your Advantage

 We’ve probably all used widgets on our phones. The compact tiles give us information at a glance without having to open apps and perform multiple clicks to get the information we want. And apart from its own widgets, Windows 11 also supports those from third parties.

![Enable Widgets from Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/enable-widgets-from-settings.jpg)

 They are so easy to use and so terribly useful, that we suggest [getting started with Windows 11 widgets](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-widgets-starter-tips/) right away. And there’s an easy fix if your [Windows 11 widgets are not working](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-widgets-not-working/) —a frustrating situation indeed to find yourself in.

### 3\. Get More Productive With Focus Sessions

 Windows 11’s Focus Sessions feature aims to boost your productivity, cutting out distractions and helping you set goals for work. The tool can be found in the clock app and allows you to set the tasks you want to focus on in each session. You can even link your Spotify account to have music playing in the background if that’s what helps you stay focused.

![windows 11 focus sessions clock app home page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/windows-11-focus-sessions-clock-app-home-page.jpg)

 We’ve got a comprehensive article on [how to use the new Windows 11 Focus Sessions](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-windows-11-focus-sessions/) , which explains what they are and guides you to set things up so you can get the most out of your time at your PC.

### 4\. Leverage the Clipboard Manager

 If you found the Windows 10 clipboard somewhat limited in capability, you’ll be pleased to know that the clipboard manager underwent something of an overhaul in Windows 11\. You can copy multiple items to the clipboard and access them easily via clipboard history. The Windows 11 clipboard even has support for emojis and kaomoji.

![The Clipboard history tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/the-clipboard-history-tab.png)

 Even though it may seem overwhelming, there’s nothing complicated about [using the improved clipboard manager in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-clipboard-manager-in-windows-11/) .

### 5\. Quicker Text Capture With Voice Typing

 Here’s another feature that you’ve probably been using on mobile already. Voice typing makes it easier for you to send text messages by simply talking into your microphone. The feature is baked into Windows 11 so you don’t have to install third-party software to make your work more productive.

[Microsoft’s voice typing tool on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-start-voice-typing-on-windows-11/) can be powerful if used correctly, and it is not difficult to [set up voice access on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-enable-voice-access/) .

### 6\. Use Taskbar Hotkeys for Fast Switching

 The Windows 11 taskbar automatically sets up hotkeys when you pin items to it. Not sure what a hotkey is? We’ve got more about them and [how to make your own hotkeys](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-a-hotkey-how-to-make-custom/) .

![Taskbar keyboard shortcut numbers for pinned apps](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keyboard-shortcut-numbers-1.jpg)

 You can quickly switch to a specific window or application by using the Windows key in conjunction with a number key that corresponds to the position of the pinned item. Especially for lower numbers, this shaves off seconds when switching between windows and apps.

### 7\. Android / Linux Emulators

 This may not be a feature that everyone is comfortable with or even needs, which is why it languishes in last place. While it is an interesting add-on, you probably won’t be using it unless it is a work-related necessity.

 The process to [install Windows Subsystem for Android](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-sideload-android-apps/) and [for Linux](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-install-run-bash/) isn’t all that straightforward, so it might keep the everyday Windows 11 user away. But keep in mind that [running Android apps on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-android-system-requirements/) will need a PC with top-notch specs.

## It Would Be Best to Familiarize Yourself With These Windows 11 Features

 Windows 11 has a few great features that can help you become more productive. Not all of them are easy to access; some Windows 11 features are quite well-hidden. You owe it to yourself to leverage the capabilities of the OS.
