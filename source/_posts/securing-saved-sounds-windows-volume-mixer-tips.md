4. When Windows asks how you want to search for drivers, select**Search automatically for drivers** .

 Windows will then start searching for updated drivers and install them automatically. Follow any onscreen instructions if needed. Once the installation process is finished, restart your computer and see if this solved your problem.

 If not, you may need to reinstall your audio drivers. To do this, open Device Manager again. Right-click on your audio device and select**Uninstall device** .

## 3\. Allow Applications to Take Exclusive Control

 If updating or reinstalling the driver didn't solve the issue, you may need to allow certain applications to take exclusive control of the audio device. Here's how to do it:

 To get started, launch Volume Mixer on your computer. If you need help, see our guide on[how to open Volume Mixer on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/open-volume-mixer-windows-11/) .

 In the Volume Mixer window, click on the**Speaker** icon to open the Properties window. Switch to the**Advanced** tab, and you'll see the**Exclusive Mode** section here.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Check both boxes next to **Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device** and**Give exclusive mode applications priority** .

 Click**Apply** \>**OK** to save the changes. Now try adjusting the volume again and check if this fixes the issue.

## 4\. Create a New User Account

 If you're still unable to save settings in Windows Volume Mixer, you may need to[create a new Windows user account](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-local-user-account/) . This process won't delete your old profile or data, but you'll need to reconfigure your settings. Once created, log out of your current account and log into the new one to see if the settings reset issue is resolved.

## 5\. Perform a Few General Windows Fixes

 If the above methods haven't solved your problem, you can try some general Windows fixes. Here are a few:

* [Repair corrupt system files](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/) \- Corrupted system files can cause various errors, such as this one. You must run the System File Checker (SFC) tool in order to fix it. This built-in Windows utility scans your system and replaces corrupted files with cached copies.
* [Perform a clean boot](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) \- A clean boot is a troubleshooting technique that reduces conflicts related to software that can cause the issue. It stops all non-Microsoft services and programs from running during startup, making it easier to identify the problem.
