## Personalizing the Windows 11 Task Manager Homepage

 The Task Manager provides a quick overview of your system's current status and shows essential information. Its Start page displays useful details such as currently running background processes, applications, CPU, and memory utilization. If you'd like to customize its appearance, change the Start page. In this article, we’ll look at how to change the Task Manager Start page in Windows 11\.

## 1\. Use Task Manager Settings

 If you want to quickly change the Task Manager Start page, you can use its Settings tab. This option requires no modification to the registry editor or additional scripts to run.

 To change the Task Manager Start page using Task Manager settings, do the following.

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box.
2. Type **taskmgr** and press **Enter** to launch Task Manager.
3. Once in Task Manager, click on **Settings** (the gear icon).
4. You'll see a **Default Start Page** drop-down menu at the top. This is where you can select the page to display when Task Manager opens.

 The options available are the following:

1. Processes
2. Performance
3. App history
4. Startup apps
5. Users
6. Details
7. Services ​​​​

 Once you make a selection, Task Manager will remember the setting and open the page you chose from now on.

## 2\. Tweak the Registry Editor

 The Registry Editor is another way to change the default Start page for Task Manager. The procedure is slightly more complex than using Task Manager Settings, but it offers more customization options. Be careful when modifying entries in the Registry Editor, as incorrect changes can cause errors or system instability. To avoid losing data, [back up your Windows registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before changing it.

 To change the Task Manager Start page using the Registry Editor, follow these steps.

1. [Open the Registry Editor window](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-registry-editor/).
2. If the UAC prompt pops up, click **Yes** to grant administrative rights.
3. In the left pane, navigate to the following key.  
`Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\TaskManager`
4. Double-click **StartUpTab** in the right pane. If there is no such entry, then right-click on the Task Manager key.
5. From the context menu, select **New > DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
6. Now name the value **StartUpTab** and double-click on it.

`0 = Processes

2 = App history  

3 = Startup apps  

4 = Users  

5 = Details

## 3\. Use a REG File

 If the registry editor isn't your thing, you can use a REG file to modify the Task Manager start page. The process does not require registry tweaking and is straightforward.

 To create a .reg file, [open Notepad](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-notepad/) and type the following:

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\TaskManager]  
  
"StartUpTab"=dword:00000000`

 Here, the last digit reflects the type of Start page.

 For example, if you want to set **Processes** as your default start page, use **0** (**00000000**). Similarly, if you want the **Details** page to display as default, set it to **5** (**00000005**).

 The other options are:

`00000001 - Performance  
  
00000002 - App history  
  
00000003 - Startup apps  
  
00000004 - Users  
  
00000006 - Services`

 Now, click **File** and select **Save as**. In the Save as dialog box, click the Save as type drop-down menu and select **All files**. Name the file with the **.reg** extension. For example, **TaskManagerStartPage.reg**.
