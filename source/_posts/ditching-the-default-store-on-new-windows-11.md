### 1\. Using Winget

 Winget is a handy Windows package manager tool available with the newer releases of Windows 10 and 11\. It makes it ridiculously easy to search and manage applications on your system. You can use it to remove any application, even the Microsoft Store app from your system. Here’s how:

1. Press the**Win + R** key to [launch the Run command box](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) . Type**cmd** and press the**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** keys to launch the Command Prompt with administrator privileges.
2. Now, we need to locate the ID of the Microsoft Store app installed on the system. Type the following command in the command prompt window and press the enter key:**Winget list Store**
3. Winget will list all the installed programs on your system containing the string “store” in their name. Find the Microsoft Store app in the list and**copy** its**ID** .
4. After that, you need to run the uninstall command using winget. The syntax is**winget uninstall \[app ID\]** . So, the command will be:  
winget uninstall Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bb
5. Press enter to execute the command and wait for it to execute successfully.

### 2\. Using PowerShell

 Before winget was officially integrated into Windows 10 and 11, there was a method to [remove the Microsoft Store app using PowerShell](https://www.makeuseof.com/remove-reinstall-microsoft-store-windows-11/) . The method still works and all you need to do is list the package name and then use the**Remove-AppxPackage** cmdlet to uninstall the Microsoft Store app from your system. Make sure to run PowerShell with elevated permissions.
