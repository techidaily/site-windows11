## Manage Battery Saver Functionality on Your Laptop Seamlessly

 Your Windows laptop features a handy battery saver mode that allows you to stretch your device's battery life. Windows archives this by lowering the screen brightness, limiting background processes, and disabling certain visual effects and animations.

2. Navigate to**System > Power & battery** .
3. Click on**Battery saver** to expand it.

 You can also prevent Windows from enabling battery saver mode on its own by selecting**Never** . Alternatively, if you want the battery saver mode to be enabled at all times, choose**Always** instead.

 Although the Settings app is the most commonly used method for configuring the battery saver mode in Windows, it's not the only option available. You can also use a command-line tool like Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell to configure the battery saver mode to turn on automatically. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Use one of the[many ways to open Command Prompt or PowerShell](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-command-prompt-powershell/) on your PC.
2. Type the following command in the console and press**Enter** .  
`powercfg /setdcvalueindex scheme_current sub_energysaver esbattthreshold <BatteryPercentage>`

 Replace**<BatteryPercentage>** in the above command with the percentage below which you want the battery saver mode to kick in automatically. Unlike the Settings app, you can specify a custom battery level percentage between 0 and 100 using the command line method.

 While PowerShell and Windows Terminal may look similar, they act very differently. Check our detailed guide to learn[the differences between PowerShell and Windows Terminal](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-terminal-vs-powershell/) .

## Easily Enable or Disable Battery Saver Mode on Windows

 Battery saver mode in Windows can come in handy when you're away from a power source. However, it's important to note that leaving battery saver mode on all the time can impact certain features, such as notifications and background app sync. Hence, it's best to enable battery saver mode only when necessary.
