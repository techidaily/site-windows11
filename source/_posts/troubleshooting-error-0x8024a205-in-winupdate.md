 Once done, restart your computer to ensure any remaining elements of the antivirus have been removed.

## 5\. Run the System File Checker

 If the error 0x8024a205 hasn’t been fixed yet, you can try running System File Checker. This tool checks for corrupted system files and repairs them if necessary. To use it, follow the below steps:

 If the issue persists, you can try resetting the Windows Update components. This will delete all current update files and settings and start from the beginning. To do this, do the following:

1. Open Command Prompt as an administrator.
2. If UAC appears on the screen, click**Yes** to give permission.
3. In the elevated Command Prompt window, type the following commands and press Enter after each one:
