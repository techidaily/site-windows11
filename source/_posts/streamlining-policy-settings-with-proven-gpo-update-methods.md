## Streamlining Policy Settings with Proven GPO Update Methods

 The Group Policy settings on Windows allow users to configure important system settings. Making changes to the Group Policy settings, however, will not take effect until those settings are refreshed.

 Fortunately, it's easy to refresh the Group Policy settings on Windows. You can also modify how frequently Group Policy settings are automatically updated.

## How to Refresh the Group Policy Settings Manually on Windows

 Although Group Policy settings are automatically refreshed at predefined intervals, there may be times when you want to refresh those settings manually. Thankfully, refreshing the Group Policy settings only requires you to run a single command in Command Prompt. Here are the steps you need to follow.

1. Press**Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type**command prompt** in the box and select**Run as administrator** .
3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. In the console, paste the following command and press**Enter** .  
`gpupdate /force`

 If you want to refresh the Group Policy settings and restart the computer, use the following command instead.

`gpupdate /boot`

 You can also choose to update computer and user policies separately. If youâ€™re only looking to update the computer policies, enter the following command:

`gpupdate /target:computer /force`

 Likewise, if you only want to update user policies, enter this command:

`gpupdate /target:user /force`

## How to Change the Automatic Group Policy Refresh Interval on Windows

 By default, Group Policy is refreshed in the background every 90 minutes with a random offset of 0 to 30 minutes. However, you can increase or decrease the refresh interval as per your requirement.

 There are a couple of ways you can go about changing the Group Policy refresh interval on Windows. You can either use the Group Policy Editor or the Registry Editor to implement this change.

 First, let's see how you can change the automatic Group Policy refresh interval via the Group Policy Editor.

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
2. Type**gpedit.msc** in the text box and press**Enter** .
3. Use the left pane to navigate to **Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Group Policy** .
4. On your right, double-click the**Set Group Policy Refresh Interval for computers** policy.
5. Select**Enabled** .
6. Set the update rate to anything up to 44,640 minutes (31 days).
7. Click**Apply** followed by**OK** .

 For instance, if you enter zero minutes, the computer tries to update Group Policy every seven seconds. This, however, can cause your system to slow down. So make sure you select a reasonable refresh interval.

 Alternatively, you can change the Group Policy refresh interval via the Registry Editor. If you use this method, make sure you [back up all the registry files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) or [create a system restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-create-restore-point-command-prompt-powershell/) before proceeding.

1. Click the magnifying icon on the taskbar to open the search menu.
2. Type**registry editor** in the search box and select**Run as administrator** .
3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. Use the left pane to navigate to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE > Software > Policies > Microsoft > Windows > System** .
5. Right-click on the**System** key and select**New > DWORD (32-bit) Value** . Name it**GroupPolicyRefreshTime** .
6. Double-click the newly created DWORD and enter the update interval (in minutes) in the**Value Data** field.
7. Click**OK** .
