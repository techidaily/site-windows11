## Festive Glamour: Inspiring Window Decorations

 The world around us takes on a festive air at Christmas time. You know it—streets are decked up, parties are happening, get-togethers are being planned, and shopping is in full swing.

 Of course, you are busy preparing for the big day and decorating your home with holiday lights and a Christmas tree.

 Don't you think it's the perfect time to give your trusted Windows PC a touch of Christmas too? It's easy to do so with some wonderful wintery themes that we've curated for your desktop.

## How to Install and Personalize a Desktop Theme

 The themes showcased here do not need an external app to use them. All themes are free and will work on Windows 11 and 10, and most even on Windows 8 (8.1) and 7\. Here's how you can install and personalize them:

1. **Download** your preferred theme to your Windows PC.
2. If the theme is from the Microsoft Store, it will automatically get added to the**Themes** section in**Personalization** once you**Open** it. Others can just be installed by**double-clicking** the**theme pack** file—they will also feature in the**Themes** section.

 To enjoy your Christmas theme beyond your desktop, you can also choose accent colors to match your theme. Here's how:

1. **Right-click** anywhere on your desktop.
2. Select**Personalize** to open the Personalization settings and select**Colors** .
3. Set the**Accent color** option to**Automatic** by clicking on the**Down Arrow** . The system will then automatically set an accent color based on the colors of the current wallpaper.
4. You can also have the same color theme on your Taskbar, Start Menu, Calendar pane, Notifications pane, and the Title Bars and Windows Borders. Just scroll down to the bottom of the**Colors** page and check the boxes next to**Show accent color on Start and taskbar** and**Show accent colors on title bars and windows borders** .
