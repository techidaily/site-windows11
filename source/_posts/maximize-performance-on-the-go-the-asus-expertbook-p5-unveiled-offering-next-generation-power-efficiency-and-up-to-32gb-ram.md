## Maximize Performance on the Go: The ASUS ExpertBook P5 Unveiled, Offering Next Generation Power Efficiency & Up to 32GB RAM

If you're looking for a Windows laptop perfect for productivity, you might want to check out the new ASUS ExpertBook P5\. It's landmark business laptop that offers a thin and light design with cutting-edge AI capabilities, Intel's latest Lunar Lake processors, and more.

 ASUS' ExpertBook P5 is among the first laptops to use an [Intel Lunar Lake](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-ways-on-how-to-unlockbypassswiperemove-vivo-y78-5g-fingerprint-lock-by-drfone-android/) CPU. The Lunar Lake platform is tailored to laptops and other mobile devices, boasting 40% less power consumption than Intel Meteor Lake mobile chips. Lunar Lake's integrated GPU offers 1.5x the performance of its predecessors, and as you may have already guessed, Lunar Lake goes all-in on AI with a beefy [Copilot+](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-my-spouse-from-spying-on-my-motorola-moto-g24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/)\-compliant NPU (neural processing unit).

 Of course, the CPU is just one part of this machine. ASUS didn't hold back any punches when designing the ExpertBook P5\. Its durable chassis meets military MIL-STD 810H durability standards, yet the laptop itself weighs just under 3 pounds. The 14-inch 16:10 screen (which is taller than most laptop screens) packs a 2.5K resolution, a 144Hz refresh rate, and an integrated anti-glare coating. Plus, the top-end configuration of this laptop comes with 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, 3TB of storage (dual SSD), an excellent port selection with both Thunderbolt 4 and HDMI connectors, and Wi-Fi 7 wireless connectivity.

 It's safe to assume that the ExpertBook P5 will offer a stellar battery life. Even if the Lunar Lake platform fails to seriously increase power efficiency, this laptop offers a bunch of AI-powered screen dimming and energy-saving features, which _should_ artificially extend the time between each charge. However, ASUS hasn't provided any details on this front. Previous ExpertBook laptops, such as the B9 and the B9450, had a battery life ranging anywhere from 11 hours to 24 hoursâ€”the ExpertBook P5's battery life is anybody's guess.

 I'd also like to point out that the Intel Lunar Lake platform is based on the traditional x86 architecture. It's a direct competitor to [AMD's Zen 5 AI 300-series processors](https://techidaily.com/the-way-to-recover-deleted-pictures-on-infinix-smart-8-without-backup-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/), but it's quite different from the ARM-based [Snapdragon X](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-mobile-mastery-upgrade-photos-elevated-at-no-price/) chipsets that have been grabbing headlines. So, the ExpertBook P5 isn't as fashionable as Snapdragon-based PCs like the [Surface Laptop 7](https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-samsung-lock-screen-clock-in-seconds-by-drfone-android/) (and it could have a worse battery life than ARM machines), but it won't suffer from any software compatibility nonsense, so it's a far better option for most professionals.

 ASUS will begin selling the ExpertBook P5 in the second half of 2024\. Pricing is currently unknown, as are some details like battery life and hardware configurations. Note that while this computer is Copilot+ compliant, Microsoft is currently limiting the Copilot+ program to ARM machines. We don't know when this program will expand beyond ARM-based PCs.
