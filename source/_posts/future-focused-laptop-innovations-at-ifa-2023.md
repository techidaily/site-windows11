 Lenovo is upgrading its Legion line of gaming laptops with its most powerful variant yet—the Lenovo Legion 9i. This massive laptop features a powerful 13th-generation Intel Core i9-13980HX processor, either an RTX 4080 or 4090 laptop GPU, up to 64GB DDR5 RAM, and up to 2TB PCIe 4.0 SSD storage.

 On top of these specifications, the laptop also features a 16-inch 3.2K Mini LED display with a 1655Hz refresh rate, 100% DCI-P3 coverage, and VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certification. And, to ensure you can maximize its power, the Legion 9i has integrated liquid cooling ([what is a water-cooled PC?](https://www.makeuseof.com/water-cooled-pc/)), allowing you to push it to its limits.

 Aside from its raw power, Lenovo's latest laptop is tapping into artificial intelligence with its LA2 chip. This allows the computer to change its system parameters in real time to deliver maximum performance.

## 2\. MSI Stealth 16 Mercedes-AMG Motorsport

 Gaming laptops are known for their speed and performance, so there's no better way to show this than by partnering with one of the fastest teams in F1 Racing. The MSI Stealth 16 Mercedes-AMG Motorsport edition features official branding, making it an excellent laptop for the team's fans and racing enthusiasts.

 Furthermore, the laptop's performance goes beyond its branding. MSI gave the computer the following specifications: up to a 13th-Gen Intel Core i9 processor, an RTX 4060 or 4070 laptop GPU, up to 64GB DDR5 RAM, and two M.2 NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD slots.

 You also get a 16-inch 4K OLED display, which runs at 60Hz. While the display's refresh rate is disappointing, it suits the built-in RTX 4060 or 4070 video card, so it's not a huge issue.

## 3\. MSI Commercial 14 H

 Aside from gaming gear, MSI also announced the MSI Commercial 14 H—a laptop focused on the security needs of businesses and corporations. This laptop can be customized according to an enterprise's need, including installing NFC ([what is NFC?](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-near-field-communication-how-does-it-work/)) and smart card readers.

 This laptop also contributes to our environment by using post-consumer recycled resin for its keyboard deck and up to 90% recycled paper for its packaging. This is perfect for companies that require bespoke computing solutions and must keep their carbon footprint below a certain level.

 Tecno is primarily known for its smartphones, but it's also jumping into a laptop computing bandwagon. It launched the Tecno MegaBook T1 in 2022, and we found [the MegaBook T1 in our review](https://www.makeuseof.com/tecno-megabook-t1-review/) that it's a great 15-inch productivity laptop.

 To make the laptop appealing to more users, Tecno is releasing a 14-inch version that only weighs 1.39kg and is less than 15mm thick. It also comes with the OneLeap feature that allows the MegaBook T1 to connect with Tecno smartphones.

## 5\. Tecno MegaBook S1 Dazzling Edition

 The MegaBook S1 isn't a new model, but Tecno is changing its exterior by using polychromatic photoisomer technology. This means that its surface color will change when exposed to UV light, giving the laptop a new hue when taken out of its bag.

 You can see this technology on Tecno's Camon 19 Pro and Vivo V-series smartphones. If you want to see the color-changing effect in action, you can check it out in [our review of the Vivo V25 Pro](https://www.makeuseof.com/vivo-v25-pro-review/).
