## Unplugging Troubles: Stay Aware of Power Save Mode

 Windows' USB selective suspend feature puts USB devices in a low-power state when not in use. While this can enhance battery life, it may cause problems with peripherals that require constant power.

 If you encounter issues with USB devices on your Windows 11 computer, consider disabling the USB selective suspend feature. Here’s how to do so on Windows 11\.

## Why You Might Want to Disable USB Selective Suspend

 Windows has various features to [prolong your laptop's battery life](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-improve-battery-life/), one of which is USB selective suspend. While this feature is great, below are a few situations where you should disable it:

* If Windows fails to recognize a USB device, try turning off USB selective suspend and check if it makes any difference.
* USB selective suspend sometimes adds a small amount of latency, especially in gaming peripherals. So, you can turn it off to get immediate and responsive input from your gaming device.
* USB selective suspend might occasionally conflict with other power management settings, potentially leading to computer instability. If you've been experiencing power-related problems, disabling USB selective suspend could help.

 Now that you know the reason, let’s check out different ways to disable USB selective suspend on Windows 11\.

## 1\. Using the Device Manager

 The Device Manager on Windows is the go-to place to manage USB devices connected to your system. You can use it to [update outdated drivers](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/find-replace-outdated-windows-drivers/), uninstall devices, and much more. It can also help you turn off the USB selective suspend feature.

 Follow these steps to disable USB selective suspend via the Device Manager:

1. Press the **Win + X** hotkey and choose **Device Manager** from the context menu.
2. Double-click on the **Universal Serial Bus controllers** node.

## USB Selective Suspend Is Good, but Not Perfect

 We've taken a look at how and when to disable USB selective suspend.
