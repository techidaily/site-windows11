## How to Set Active Hours and Avoid Sudden Updates on Windows 11

 Typically, the installation of Windows updates necessitates a system restart, which can cause disruptions during critical work sessions. However, by configuring active hours, you can define the specific times during which you generally use your computer for work. Once you do, Windows will schedule update installations to occur outside of these active hours, ensuring that your work sessions remain uninterrupted.

 You can set active hours in Windows via the Settings app, the Group Policy Editor, or the Registry Editor. Let’s go through each of these methods in detail.
