## Simplified DOCX to PDF Workflow in Windows 11 Systems

 You can open Microsoft Word’s DOCX files with many word processors, but they won’t always look the same across different software packages. Not all word processors support the same formatting as Word. Consequently, DOCX files can sometimes look a bit (maybe even very) different when viewed in other software, especially on non-Windows devices.

 Fortunately, you can convert DOCX files into the universal PDF file format will ensure they look the same for whomever you share documents with. PDF is a universal file format that preserves original formatting and page layout. This is how you can convert DOCX files to PDFs in Windows 11\.

## How to Convert DOCX Files Into PDF With Microsoft Word

 If you have Microsoft Word installed with an active subscription, you can convert DOCX files to PDF format with that software. Word includes an option for creating XPS and PDF documents.

 You can convert DOCX files to PDF with that option as follows:

1. Open a DOCX file to convert to PDF with Microsoft Word.
2. Click **File** on the far left of Word’s tab bar.
3. Select **Export** in the **File** tab.
4. Then click **Create PDF/XPS Document**.

7. Click **Publish** to save the converted Word PDF document. That PDF will then automatically open in the Edge browser, which all Windows users can view the file with.

Click on the **Save as type** drop-down menu to select PDF. Then select **Save** to finish.

## How to Convert DOCX Files to PDF With a Web App

 You can only export one DOCX file at a time to the PDF format with the MS Word method. It’s better to utilize a web app if you need to convert multiple DOCX files to PDFs.
