## 3\. How to Hide Email Address From Windows Login Screen Using the Registry Editor

 If the above two methods don’t work for some reason, you can make changes to the Windows registry files to hide your email address from the login screen. For that, you’ll need to use the Registry Editor on Windows.

 When it comes to editing Registry files, it's important to be cautious as making incorrect changes can cause irreversible damage to your PC. We recommend you either back up all the registry files or create a restore point before you make any changes. If you need help with that, check our guides on [how to back up the Windows registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) and [how to create a restore point in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) .

 Once you’re done with that, use the following steps to hide your email address from the Windows login screen via Registry Editor.

1. Press**Win + X** to open the Power User menu and select**Run** from the list.
2. Type**regedit** in the text box and press**Enter** to open the Registry Editor.
3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. Use the left pane to navigate to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE > SOFTWARE > Policies > Microsoft > Windows > System** .
5. Right-click on the**System** key and select**New > DWORD (32-bit) Value** .
6. Rename the DWORD to**BlockUserFromShowingAccountDetailsOnSignin** .
