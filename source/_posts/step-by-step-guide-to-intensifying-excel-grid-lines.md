 Microsoft Excel provides you with [gridlines](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/easy-guide-to-installing-amd-radeon-hd-7700-graphics-card-driver-updates/) on each spreadsheet in a workbook by default. However, the gridlines might be too faint on your screen. If you'd like to make the gridlines darker in Excel, we'll show you how.

 There are two simple methods for making the gridlines bolder and easier to see. You can [use a darker color](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/digital-illusions-mastery-of-partial-picture-softness/) than the default light gray or you can apply a grid border to the entire sheet. Let's look at both options so you can pick the one that best fits your needs.

##  Use a Darker Gridline Color in Settings

 Open a workbook in Excel, select the File tab, and pick "Options."

![Choose File, Options](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/FileOptions-ExcelDarkenGridlines.png) 

 Choose "Advanced" on the left side of the pop-up window. On the right, scroll down to Display Options for This Worksheet.

 You'll see a drop-down box in the section heading that displays your currently selected sheet. So if you prefer to apply the change to a different sheet, you can select that one instead.

![Select a different sheet box](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/OptionsSelectSheet-ExcelDarkenGridlines.png) 

 At the bottom of the section, click the drop-down box next to Gridline Color and choose an option. You can pick a basic black or make the gridlines pop with a bright color.

 Click "OK" to apply the change.

 To revert the change and use the default gridline color, return to the same area in the Options and pick "Automatic" in the color drop-down box.

##  Apply a Border to the Sheet

 If you want bold gridlines in addition to darker ones, the best method is [applying a border](https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-effective-ways-to-unlock-icloud-account-without-password-on-apple-iphone-14-by-drfone-ios/) to the entire sheet. This allows you to choose a basic or custom border.
