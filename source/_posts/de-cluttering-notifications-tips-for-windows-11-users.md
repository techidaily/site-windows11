## The Two Different Kinds of Widget Notifications on Windows 11

 Widgets use two types of notifications—rotating announcements, and badge notifications.

 Rotating announcements are shown in the taskbar and are intended to notify you of new developments quickly. The taskbar will generally show the current weather but will momentarily switch to display the announcement from the specific widget.

 Furthermore, widgets make use of a badge notification to catch your eye when there are important updates about the weather or news. If you want to know more about the notification, you can open the Widgets panel and see what caused the notification to appear.

## How to Change the Notification Settings for Widgets on Windows 11

 There are two main channels that you can use to stay informed on the latest updates for your configured widgets. You can either periodically launch the widgets panel and glance over your widgets or set up notifications to keep you informed on new developments.

 Widget notifications appear in the taskbar as rotating updates. If there's an important announcement about the things you're interested in and the widgets you use, a banner will appear in the taskbar.

 If you want to change the widget notification settings on Windows 11:

1. Launch the **Widgets** board through the icon on the **taskbar** or by pressing its dedicated keyboard shortcut, **Win + W**.

2. Click on the profile picture icon to open Widget settings.
3. Under the **Widget taskbar behaviors**, toggle the **Show notification badges** and **Show announcements** options as per your preference.

 Ideally, you want to show announcements for widgets that are very relevant to your interests—the topics you want instant updates on. Badge notifications without announcements are good for more casual interests that you don't want disturbing you every time something happens, and rarely-used widgets can have all of these disabled.
