## Team Chat Freezing? Here’s a Fix

 The screen-sharing feature in Microsoft Teams can be useful when you need to present something during a video conference. Although the feature has been available for a while now, it is still not without its flaws.

 Sometimes, when you try to share your screen in Microsoft Teams on Windows, you may get a black screen or an error message. If you encounter this problem, here are some tips that will help resolve the issue in no time.

## 1\. Start With Some Basic Fixes

 It's a good idea to start with some simple solutions before delving into more complex ones.

* **Close and Reopen the App:** At times, temporary glitches with the Teams app can cause it to misbehave on your Windows computer. If it’s nothing major, simply closing the app and reopening it should help solve the problem.
* **Repair the App:** Your Windows 10 or 11 computer includes a useful repair feature that can automatically [identify and resolve minor issues with UWP apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-repair-apps-programs/). You can use this feature to repair the Microsoft Teams app and see if it solves your problem.
* **Update Display Drivers:** Outdated or corrupted display drivers can also cause screen-sharing issues in Microsoft Teams. If that's the case, [updating the display drivers on your Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) should fix the issue.
* **Install Windows Updates:** The screen sharing not working issue in Teams could be due to a bug within the current Windows build on your PC. [Install any pending Windows updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/) and try to share the screen again.

## 2\. Make Sure Everyone Is Allowed to Present Screen

 A common reason why screen-sharing may not work in Microsoft Teams is if the administrator has not enabled the presentation permission for all users.

 You will need to ask the admin to enable screen-sharing permission using these steps:

1. On the Microsoft Teams call screen, click the three-dot menu icon at the top.
2. Select **Settings > Meeting options**.
3. Under **Who can present** and select **Everyone**.
4. Click the **Save** button.

## 3\. Rule Out Issues With Your Internet Connection

 If you are unable to share the screen despite having the required permissions, there may be an issue with your internet connection. As features like screen sharing necessitate a fast internet connection, you’re likely to encounter problems if your internet connection is slow or unstable.

 You can visit a website like Speedtest to [test your internet connection and speed](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/). If your internet appears to be slow, switch to a different network connection and try to share the screen again.

## 4\. Close Background Apps and Programs

 Even if you have a fast internet connection, you may experience problems if background apps and services on your PC are consuming a significant portion of your bandwidth. To avoid this, review the apps and programs running in the background and close the ones you don’t need.

 Follow these steps to continue:

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open the Task Manager.
2. In the **Processes** tab, go through the list to locate and select the apps and programs you aren’t using.
3. Click the **End task** option at the top to terminate them.

## 5\. Try Lowering the Display Resolution

 Another thing you can do is lower the display resolution while sharing the screen in Microsoft Teams. This should help reduce the amount of system resources and internet bandwidth Microsoft Teams requires for screen sharing, resulting in a smoother experience.

 Follow these steps to change the screen resolution on Windows:

1. Press **Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. Head to **System > Display**.
3. Click the drop-down menu next to **Display resolution** to select a lower resolution.  
![Change Display Resolution in Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/change-display-resolution-in-windows.jpg)

 After lowering the screen resolution, try to share your screen again in Teams.

## 6\. Clear Microsoft Teams App Cache

 Microsoft Teams creates temporary files on your device to speed up loading times and enhance your overall experience. If you have been using the Teams app for a while, it may have accumulated a lot of cache data. While this data is intended to be helpful, it can end up interfering with the app's performance if it becomes corrupted.

 To fix this, you need to remove the existing cache files associated with the Teams app on your PC. Since this process doesn’t affect any of the essential app data, there’s no harm in trying it.

 Follow these steps to continue:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
2. Copy and paste the following path in the text box and click **OK**:  
`%appdata%\Microsoft\teams`
3. Press **Ctrl + A** to select all the files and folders inside the Teams folder.
4. Click the **trash icon** at the top to delete them.  
![Clear Microsoft Teams Cache in Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/clear-microsoft-teams-cache-in-windows.jpg)

 Close File Explorer, restart the Teams app, and check if the issue is still there.

## 7\. Update or Reinstall Microsoft Teams

 Using an outdated version of the Teams app can lead to performance issues and cause certain features to stop working. Microsoft regularly releases updates for the Teams app to improve your experience and address known issues. Hence, it is always advisable to use the most recent version of the Teams app.

 In the Teams app, click the **menu icon** at the top and select **Settings**.Switch to the **About Teams** tab and check if a newer version is available.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 In case the issue remains, your best option is to uninstall the Teams app and install it again. To do so, press **Win + S** to access the search menu. Type **Microsoft Teams** in the search box and select the **Uninstall** option. Select **Uninstall** again to confirm.

![Uninstall Microsoft Teams on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/uninstall-microsoft-teams-on-windows.jpg)

 Once removed, head over to [Microsoft’s website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app) to download and install Teams again.

## 8\. Use Chrome or Edge While Sharing Screen in Teams for Web

 Are you unable to share the screen while using Microsoft Teams in your browser? That could happen if you are using Teams in Firefox, Opera, or Brave.

 Microsoft recommends using only Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge for using Teams on the web. Try switching to either of those browsers and see if you are able to share your screen after that.
