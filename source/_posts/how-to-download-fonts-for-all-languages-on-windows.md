## How to Download Fonts for All Languages on Windows

 If you frequently work with different languages, you might want to ensure you can get every font available for them. And while you can install fonts individually as needed, it can be inconvenient, especially if you're in the middle of work.

 So, why not download every available font for all languages in Windows? Remember, though, that doing so will take up a lot of your storage, so ensure you have enough free space to accommodate them.

 Check out the steps below to see how you can download fonts for all languages in the Settings app and the Control Panel. Let's get to it.

2. In the**Related settings** section, click on**Download fonts for all languages** . On Windows 11, you'll have to expand the section first; on Windows 10, you'll have to scroll down, past the fonts, to find it.
