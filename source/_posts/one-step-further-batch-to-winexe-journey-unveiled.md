## One Step Further: Batch-to-WinEXE Journey Unveiled

 While both Batch and EXE files help you execute programs on your PC, you might find yourself in situations where you can run specific files only in the EXE format. For example, the EXE files can execute many more commands than the Batch files. Moreover, it's also pretty tidy when you can simply consolidate your scattered Batch files into a single, compact .exe format.

 In what follows, that's precisely what we're going to cover. We’ll look at the top two ways to convert your Batch files into an EXE format, and lay out the process for you.

## Convert Your Batch Files Into an EXE File

 Now, there are two broad ways to go about it. First, you can rely on a handy converter and let it convert your BAT files to EXE file. But, if you’re more of a do-it-yourself person, you can also go the manual way. Let’s dive into using the in-built Windows tool first.

## Convert Your Batch Files to EXE with IExpress

[IExpress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IExpress) is a free Windows program, in use since Windows 2000, specifically designed to create self-extracted packages. This is what makes it super handy for converting your Batch (BAT) files into EXE ones as well.

To launch the IExpress app, follow the steps below:

1. Head to the**Start menu** search bar, and type in ‘iexpress’. From the best match, right-click on iexpress.exe and run it as administrator.
2. As soon as you do this, the IExpress Wizard will be launched. Choose the**Create new Self Extraction Directive (SED)** radio box from there, and click on**Next** .
3. Pick the**Extract files** **and run an installation command** radio box from the**Package purpose** window, and click on**Next** .

4. Enter a name for the**Package** **title** and hit**Next** again.

5. Select**No prompt** and hit**Next** .

6. Select**Do not display** **a license** and click on**Next** .
7. Click on**Add** to select the batch script you want to convert, and click on the**Next** button.
8. From the**Install Program** field, type in the following command and hit**Next** :  
cmd /c Calculator.bat

![install program to launch](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/install-program-to-launch.JPG)

 In our example, we're converting a Batch file that contains a simple calculator. Therefore, in the command_cmd /c Calculator.bat_ , the name of our batch file is '_Calculator.bat_ '. Since your Batch file will be likely different, make sure you change the command accordingly.

 Stick with the default option in the**Show window** and**Finished message** menu, and click**Next** . Now, in the**Package Name and Options** menu, select**Browse** to pick a target path, name the file anything you’d like, and click on**Next** . In the following few pages, click on**Next** without changing anything.

![saving new file](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/saving-new-file.JPG)

 Finally, on the**Create package** page, click on**Next** again. That’s it, folks. Your EXE package will be created in a few minutes. All you’ve to do from there is to head to the destination folder and launch the file for verifying.
