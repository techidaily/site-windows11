## Master Window's Performance With Extended Display Setup

 Laptops are great for portability, but they often have small screens. While you can easily connect an external monitor to your Windows laptop to get more screen real estate, this can sometimes cause unexpected problems, such as lag or performance issues.

 Below, we will explore several effective troubleshooting tips that can help resolve performance issues with your Windows laptop when it is connected to an external display.

## 1\. Make Sure Your Laptop Is Compatible With the External Monitor

 One of the most common reasons why your Windows laptop may lag is if it lacks the minimum hardware requirements to support the monitor. This usually happens when your laptop's graphics card isn't powerful enough to handle the monitor's resolution. Try [lowering the resolution of the external monitor](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-change-screen-resolution/) to see if that resolves the lag.

## 2\. Change the Screen Refresh Rate

 A monitor's refresh rate is how many times per second the screen updates the image. If your laptop's graphics card or integrated graphics is not powerful enough to handle the monitor's higher refresh rate, it may have difficulty keeping up with the increased frame output, which can cause stuttering or tearing in the image.

 You can try changing the refresh rate for your monitor to see if that solves the problem.

1. Press **Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. Head to **System > Display > Advanced display**.
3. Click on **Display adapter properties for Display 1**.
4. Switch to the **Monitor** tab and click the drop-down menu under **Screen refresh rate** to select **60 Hertz**.
5. Hit **Apply** followed by **OK**.

## 5\. Try Some Generic Fixes

 Still having problems? Don't fret, you can try the following generic solutions to solve the problem.

* **Update Your Graphics Drivers:** An outdated or incompatible graphics driver may be the cause of your Windows laptop lagging. Hence, it’s a good idea to [update the graphics drivers on your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) if you have not already done so.
* **Try a Clean Boot:**[Performing a clean boot](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-perform-clean-boot-windows-10/) can help you determine if a third-party program or service is causing your Windows laptop to lag. If you do not experience any lag while in a clean boot state, you will need to uninstall any suspicious apps or programs to fix the problem.
