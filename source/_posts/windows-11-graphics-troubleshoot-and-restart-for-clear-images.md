 The most straightforward way to reset the graphics card driver on Windows is by using the keyboard shortcut. For that, use the key combination**Win + Ctrl + Shift + B.** This key combination would instantly refresh your graphics driver on your Windows system. You will observe that your screen will be flashing for a second or two, and then all will be back to normal.

 You should be aware that this activity is safe and won't interfere with any of the apps that are already operating on your device. Furthermore, you can perform this activity without using the [Windows administrator account](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-administrator-account-everything-need-know/) .

 Also, keep in mind that this keyboard shortcut might not function while you are playing games. This is because video games generally take command of the keyboard, preventing Windows from using it.

## What If the Graphical Issues Persist?

 If you have performed all the troubleshooting steps mentioned above to reset your graphics card driver and still face display issues, you can try the following fixes:

* **Update Windows** : Many graphical problems can be resolved by just [updating the Windows version](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-install-updates/) that you are running. You can check for the latest updates in the Settings app and install them automatically or download the ISO file from Microsoft's official website.
* **Update graphics drivers** : Head to your graphics card manufacturer's website and check for the latest available drivers. Download and install them accordingly to see if it resolves the display issues.
* **Run the Display Troubleshooter** : Windows 10 and 11 come with an in-built troubleshooting tool. This tool can detect and resolve any glitches or compatibility issues with your graphics driver automatically.
* **Check your monitor** : It is possible that the display problems are caused by your monitor itself, as not all monitors are compatible with all video cards. Try using a different monitor or check for its compatibility with the graphics card you have installed on your system.
* **Check hardware components** : Examine your device's cooling fan and other hardware components to ensure there is no blocking or dust on them. If blocked, clean it using a vacuum cleaner and check if the display issues persist.
* **Update BIOS** : Outdated BIOS can also cause graphical problems on your system.[Always update your device's BIOS regularly](https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-why-you-should-update-pc-bios/) regularly to fix any existing glitches.
* **Check connections** : Check the cable connections between your PC and the monitor. Make sure the connections are secure, and no wires are loose. Also, try connecting a different cable, if possible, to make sure the issue is not with the cable itself.
* **Reach out to Customer Care** : If none of the above steps work, contact your device or graphics card manufacturer's customer care for further assistance. You can also opt for a professional to troubleshoot the issue.

## Stay Away From Display Issues on Windows

 You don't want to be stuck in the middle of a project with display problems. The steps mentioned above should help you reset your graphics driver and fix any display issues that you may have been experiencing on your system.

 Apart from that, make sure that you regularly update your graphics drivers and Windows version. Also, ensure that all your hardware components are in top-notch condition, and check for any loose connections before starting work on your PC.
