## Amplify Your PC's Wi-Fi with 8 Effective Fixes for Windows 11

 Sometimes, Windows 11 will show you a "Limited Access" warning on your network connection, either out of the blue or after you've made a change to your networking settings. When the error appears, you PC can no longer access the internet or different network resources, despite being connected to the router.

 Thankfully, you can fix the problem by yourself. We’ll show you the most common fixes to get rid of the "Limited Access" issue.

## 1\. Check Your ISP's Data Plan

 Even if Windows shows the Limited access message when you connect to the Wi-Fi, there’s a chance you don’t have any system or connectivity issues.

 Depending on your ISP (or Internet Service Provider), you might have limited or unlimited data. If you have a data cap, and you exceed it, your Wi-Fi network might show limited access once you connect to it.

 You can check how much data you’ve used through Windows Settings. Press**Win + I** to bring up the Settings menu. Head to **Network & Internet > Advanced network settings > Data usage** . There, check your data usage and compare it with your data cap.

## 8\. Stop Windows From Turning Off the Network Adapter

 Depending on your power management settings, Windows might turn off the network adapter if your computer has a low battery. While this may keep your computer working longer, it will cause the Wi-Fi network to show limited access.

 Right-click the network adapter and open the**Power management** tab. There, uncheck the**Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power** option.
