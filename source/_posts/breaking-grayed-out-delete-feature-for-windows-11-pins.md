## Breaking Grayed-Out Delete Feature for Windows 11 PINs

 Windows 11 requires you to set up a PIN irrespective of whether you want to use a Microsoft account, fingerprint, or facial recognition feature to sign in to your computer. PIN sign-in in Windows 11 is part of Windows Hello, which makes it safer than password sign and easier to remember as well.

 However, when you try to remove your PIN, you may find the option grayed out in the Settings app. Fortunately, fixing this problem is easy enough. Here's how you can disable the feature and fix the Remove PIN option grayed-out issue on Windows 11.
