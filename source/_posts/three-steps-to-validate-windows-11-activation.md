## Three Steps to Validate Windows 11 Activation

 Although Microsoft allows you to use Windows 11 without activation, using a non-activated copy may not be the best idea as it restricts your access to certain key features and critical security updates. If you’re unsure, there are several ways to know if your copy of Windows 11 is activated.

 You can check your Windows 11 PC’s activation status via the Settings app, the Run command, or a command-line tool. This post will walk you through all three methods in detail.

## 1\. How to Check Windows 11's Activation State Using the Settings App

 The Settings app in Windows contains all the necessary information about the Windows edition, its activation status, and the product key.

 To check Windows 11 activation status using the Settings app, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + I** to launch the Settings app.
2. In the**System** tab, click on**Activation** .
3. Check the status next to**Activation state** .

 If the status reads**Active** , it means your Windows 11 copy is activated. On the other hand, if the status displays**Not active** , it implies that the copy of your Windows 11 is not yet activated.

 You can click the**Activation state** option to reveal more details. Depending on the activation status, you should see one of the following messages:

* Windows is activated.
* Windows is activated with a digital license.
* Windows is activated with a digital license linked to your Microsoft account.
* Windows is not activated.

## 2\. How to Check Windows 11 Activation State via the Run Command

 Run command is a useful tool for executing commands, opening system utilities, and[launching apps and programs in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/open-apps-programs-windows/) . You can also use this tool to see Windows' activation status.

 Here’s how to check if Windows 11 is activated via the Run command.

1. Right-click on the**Start icon** and select**Run** from the list. Alternatively, you can use the**Win + R** keyboard shortcut to access the Run tool quickly.
2. Type**slmgr.vbs /xpr** in the text field and click**OK** or press**Enter** .
3. You should see a**Windows Script Host** dialog box that’ll convey whether your copy of Windows 11 is activated or not.

 Alternatively, you can run the**slmgr.vbs /dlv** command to check the activation status along with other important details such as activation ID, partial product key, and so on.

## 3\. How to Check Windows 11 Activation State With Command Prompt or PowerShell

 Command Prompt and PowerShell are two built-in command-line tools in Windows 11 commonly used for performing complex administrative tasks and troubleshooting various errors. However, did you know you could also use these tools to reveal essential system information such as Windows' activation state?

 To check the Windows 11 activation state using Command Prompt or PowerShell, use these steps:

1. Use one of[the many ways to open Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-command-prompt-powershell/) .
2. In the console, type**slmgr /xpr** and press**Enter** .
