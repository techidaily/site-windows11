### 1\. Hide the Power Button on the Start Menu with the Windows Registry

 To hide the Power Button through the Windows Registry, all you have to do is change a critical value, and your job will be done. However, before you jump in and do that, it’s essential that you [back up your Windows registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) first. Fiddling with the Registry is risky business, and having your keys backed up will keep it safe even in the case of accidental data loss.

 After you have backed up your Windows Registry, follow the below steps to hide the Power button on your Windows:

1. Launch the **Run** dialog box by pressing the **Windows key + R** shortcut.
2. Type in 'regedit' and hit **Enter**.
3. In the Registry Editor, head to the following location:  
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\default\Start\HidePowerButton
4. Right-click on the **Value** key from the right and change its value to **1**.
