## The Pathway for Effortless Changes of File Extensions

 At times, you might find it necessary to change a file's type or extension on your computer. Whether it's to ensure compatibility with different software or simply modify how the file appears to users, there are several options to alter a file's type or extension on Windows.

 Here we walk you through three easy ways to change file types on your Windows 10 or 11 computer.

## 1\. Rename the File Extention to Change the File Type

 The easiest way to change a file’s type on Windows is to rename it. However, there are some limitations to this method. For instance, if you change a .txt file extension to .jpg, the file will not transform into an image; its content will remain textual. However, you can use this method to easily convert a JPEG file to JPG.

 To change a file’s type using the Rename option, make sure you have [configured Windows to show file extensions](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-make-windows-10-show-file-extensions/). After that, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + E** to open File Explorer and locate your file.
2. Right-click on your file and select the **Rename** option.
3. Replace the older file extension with the new one, and then press **Enter** to save it.
4. Click **Yes** when the prompt appears.

 And that’s about it. Your file’s type will be changed. If you want to change the file type for several files at once, you can use a tool like PowerToys to [batch rename files on your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/batch-rename-files-powertoys-powerrename/).

## 2\. Use the "Save As" Option to Change a File's Type

 As mentioned previously, changing a file's type on Windows using the Rename option may not always work. If you want to convert a file's type without making it unusable, you can use the Save As option.

 Most modern-day programs, such as Microsoft Word, Photoshop, Canva, and so on, support a wide range of formats for saving files, making it convenient to convert files. This way, you can do complex conversions like DOCX to PDF or PNG to JPG properly.

 To change a file’s type on Windows using the Save As option, use these steps:

1. Open your file in a program that supports both your source and your target formats. For instance, if you were to convert a DOCX file to PDF, you would open it in Microsoft Word.
2. Head to **File > Save As** option.
3. Click the drop-down menu next to **Save as type** to select your preferred format from the list.
4. Select your preferred location for saving the file and click the **Save** button.
