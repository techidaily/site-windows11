## 1\. Enable Show Desktop Icons

 On Windows 11, you can show or hide desktop icons with a couple of clicks. So, if you’ve accidentally hidden your desktop icons, getting them back is fairly easy.

 Right-click anywhere on an empty spot on your desktop and select**View > Show desktop icons** . Once you do that, all your hidden desktop icons should reappear.

## 2\. Check Desktop Icon Settings

 If you're only missing a few desktop icons, such as This PC, Recycle Bin, Control Panel, and others, you may have disabled them in the "Desktop Icon Settings" window. In that case, you can use the following steps to re-enable those desktop icons.

1. Open the**Start menu** and click the**gear icon** to launch the Settings app.
2. Select**Personalization** from the left sidebar.
3. Select**Themes** .
4. Under**Related settings** , click on**Desktop icon settings** .
5. Under the**Desktop icons** section, use the checkboxes to enable the icons you want on your desktop.
6. Click**Apply** followed by**OK** to save the changes.  
![Desktop Icon Settings Window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Desktop-Icon-Settings-Window.jpg)

 Once you complete the above steps, your icons should appear on the desktop.

## 3\. Restart Windows Explorer

 The Windows Explorer process handles the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a number of utilities, including the desktop. If this service encounters any issues, your desktop and taskbar icons may disappear. If this is the case, you can restart the Windows Explorer process to fix the problem.

1. Right-click on the Start icon or press**Win + X** to open the Power User menu.
2. Select**Task Manager** from the list.
3. In the**Processes** tab, locate**Windows Explorer** . Right-click on it and select**Restart** .

 Your taskbar will disappear for a brief moment and then reappear. Following this, your desktop icons should be visible.

## 4\. Rebuild Icon Cache

 Another reason why desktop icons on Windows may appear broken or go missing is if the existing icon cache data is corrupt. In that case, you can try clearing the corrupted icon cache data. This will force Windows to rebuild the icon cache from scratch and resolve your problem.

To rebuild icon cache on Windows 11:

1. Press**Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type**command prompt** in the box and select**Run as administrator** .
3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. Paste the following command in the console and press**Enter** to navigate to the directory where Windows stores the icon cache.  
`cd /d %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer`
5. Run the following command to terminate the Explorer process:  
`taskkill /f /im explorer.exe`
6. Paste this command and press**Enter** to delete icon cache files:  
`del iconcache*`

7. Finally, type in the following text and hit**Enter** to restart Explorer:  

`Explorer.exe`

 Once you complete the above steps, restart your PC and see if the desktop icons appear.

## 5\. Update Your PC’s Graphics Driver

 An outdated graphics driver on Windows can also lead to such anomalies. You can try updating the faulty driver using Device Manager to see if that helps. Here's how to do it.

1. Press**Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type**device manager** in the search box and select the first result that appears.
3. Expand**Display adapters** .
4. Right-click on your graphics driver and select**Update driver** .
5. Select**Search automatically for drivers** to let Windows find and install the best drivers.  
![Update Graphics Driver on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Update-Graphics-Driver-on-Windows.jpg)

 If the issue persists even after updating the driver, your graphics driver may be corrupt. In that case, you'll need to reinstall the graphics driver on your PC. Refer to our guide on[how to fix corrupt drivers on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-corrupt-drivers-on-windows-10/) for more instructions on how to fix this.

## 6\. Check the Group Policy Settings

 The Group Policy Editor lets you make various system-wide changes on your Windows computer. If desktop icons are disabled from the Group Policy Editor, you won’t be able to add or remove desktop icons no matter what you do. To fix this, you must disable this “Hide and disable all items on the desktop” from the Group Policy Editor.

 Note that you can only access the Group Policy Editor on Windows 11 Professional, Enterprise, and Education editions. If you’re running Windows 11 Home, check our guide on[how to access the Local Group Policy Editor on Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/) before continuing.

1. Click the magnifying icon on the taskbar to open the search menu.
2. Type**gpedit.msc** in the box and press**Enter** . This will open the Local Group Policy Editor.
3. Use the left pane to navigate to **User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Desktop** .
4. Double-click the**Hide and disable all items on the desktop** policy on your right.
5. Select**Not configured** or**Disabled** .
6. Click**Apply** followed by**OK** .
