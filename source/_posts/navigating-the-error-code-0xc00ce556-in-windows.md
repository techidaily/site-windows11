## Navigating the Error Code 0xC00CE556 in WINDOWS

 Error 0xC00CE556 is a Windows 11/10 issue that occurs when users try to run certain apps or games. The "Error parsing... Parsing returned error 0xC00XE556." message pops up when users try to run programs. The error message also includes a path referencing a machine.config file.

 As a result, you can't run the app for which the error 0xC00CE556 message pops up. So, are you wondering how to fix that error? This is how you can resolve error 0xC00CE556 in Windows 11/10.

## 1\. Scan System Files With SFC

 SFC is the System File Checker utility for repairing corrupted Windows files. That utility could come in handy for fixing error 0xC00CE556\. To apply this possible fix, follow the steps in this how-to[guide for using the System File Checker](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) .

## 2\. Replace a Corrupted Machine.config File

 The most common cause of error 0xC00CE556 is a corrupted machine.config file cited in the parsing error message. Machine.config is a file linked with .NET Framework that stores web app (ASP.NET) configuration data. Lots of users have fixed error 0xC00CE556 by replacing the machine.config file like this:

1. First, click the taskbar button (or folder library icon) to open File Explorer.
2. Open the Config folder by inputting this path in Explorer's directory address bar and pressing**Enter** :  
`C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config`
3. Right-click the**machine.config** file and select the**Delete** (trash bin) option to erase it.

4. Next, right-click the**machine.config.default** file and select the context menu's**Rename** option.

5. Change the file's name to machine.config.
6. Press the**Yes** button on the**Rename** dialog box.
7. Close out of Explorer to restart the PC.

## 3\. Enable .NET Framework Features

 Error 0xC00CE556 is also linked with .NET Framework because the .NET Framework directory includes the machine.config file. So, enabling advanced .NET Framework features is a potential fix that's worth a try if resolution two doesn't do the trick. This is how you can enable .NET Framework features in Windows 11/10:

1. [Open the Windows Programs and Features Tool](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-programs-and-features-tool/) .
2. Click the**Turn Windows features on** navigation link on the left side of the Programs and Features applet.
3. Then click the**+** box for .NET Framework 3.5 to expand that feature.
4. Select the**Windows Communication Foundation HTTP Activation** and**Windows Communication Foundation Non-HTTP Activation** checkboxes.

## 4\. Configure a Clean Boot

 Several users have also confirmed that clean booting fixed error 0xC00CE556 on their PCs. That highlights that this issue can occur because third-party apps or services are conflicting with .NET Framework. Setting a clean boot will disable third-party startup programs and services from automatically starting.
