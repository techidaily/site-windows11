## What Is a Keygen? Examining Its Impacts and Cleanup Techniques for PCs

 Have you run a scan on your device and found it infected with HackTool:Win32/Keygen? Windows Defender may have automatically alerted you about the presence of this malware after you used a crack or key generator to activate a premium software. Is it a serious threat, and can you remove it easily?

 In this article, we'll explain the malware in more detail, how it infected your device, and what you can do to remove it.

## How Does HackTool:Win32/Keygen Infect a Device?

 Recent years have seen an upswing in the popularity of software cracks and fake key generators. Using these tools, users can unethically activate licenses for third-party software that would usually cost them a fair amount.

 As these tools are freely available on third-party websites and many internet users are constantly looking for ways to obtain premium software at no cost, hackers use them to spread malware.

 Therefore, scammers bundle malware with a key generator, and when users download and install such programs on their devices, the victims unknowingly allow viruses to invade them. Sadly, the whole thing happens with the victim's consent. The HackTool:Win32/Keygen virus also gets inside a victim's device with the help of similar fake key generators.

## What Makes HackTool:Win32/Keygen a Serious Threat?

 HackTool:Win32/Keygen malware is categorized as a dangerous program by Microsoft Defender with a Severe threat level.

 This malware poses a severe threat due to its ability to automatically create executable files within the key generator or the software you activated. Files of this nature are hard to locate, and infection will remain on your device until these files are removed.

 Although Microsoft Defender often quarantines this threat, which limits its ability to spread further, it cannot automatically remove it. Therefore, it may be found on your device every time you run a scan. The only way to completely remove the malware from your device is by taking the manual route.

### 3\. Delete the Suspicious Files From the Main Software

 Activating software with cracks or fake key generators alters the software files to make them appear as if the software was activated. Depending on the crack you're using, it may add some malicious files to the software folder so that its premium features remain active. So deleting the key generator software alone won't help much.

 To eradicate the malware, you must remove these extra malicious files from the main software folder. Since most malicious files are hidden in the folder, you must unhide them first. To do this, click the**View** tab, expand the**Show** menu and click**Hidden items** .

![Click View, then Show and then Hidden Items to View IconCache File](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Click-Show-Hidden-Items-to-View-Files.jpg)

 Following that, follow these steps to remove the malware files from the recently activated software:

1. Open the**File Explorer** .
2. Open the installation folder for the software you used a crack or key generator for.
3. Look through its files and folders to see if you find anything suspicious.
4. If you notice a suspicious or extra file, search the file name on the web to see if it's part of your primary software or the suspicious file you need to get rid of.
5. Delete the file from your device if it is not part of the main software.  
![Deleting the Suspicious Files of the Main Software After Locating them in the Windows File Explorer App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/3-3.jpg)

 Delete these files and [run a Microsoft Defender scan](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-remove-malware-using-microsoft-defenders-offline-scan/) again. Following that, check the Protection History to see if the threat still exists. If the threat is present, you should then use a third-party malware removal tool to remove the malware.

## 4\. Make Use of a Third-Party Virus Removal Tool

 When manually deleting the key generator software and suspicious files from the main software fails to remove the virus, you should run a virus scan using a third-party virus removal tool. If you don't already have one, download one from our [list of best antivirus software](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-antivirus-apps/) .

 After that, install the software and allow it to complete a scan on your device and remove any suspicious files it finds. Upon completing the scan with a dedicated malware removal tool, your device should be malware-free.

 What if the antivirus program fails to detect and remove malware, and the malicious files remain hidden on your device? You should then delete the software you activated with a key generator.

## 5\. Remove the Software Itself

 The antivirus will likely remove suspicious files, and you won't need to delete the main software you activated with the malicious crack or key generator software. It should only be considered as a last resort if the problem persists.

 The main software can be removed from**Control Panel > Programs and Features** . Right-click the software and click**Uninstall** . Next, go to its installation folder on your device and delete any remaining files and folders.

## Tips to Prevent Infection With Similar Malware

 After removing the virus, it's imperative to ensure that similar viruses won't infect your device again. To prevent infection from malware like HackTool:Win32/Keygen, follow these tips:

* Don't activate the software using third-party key generators.
* Don't trust sources that promise free installation of software with premium features.
* Download the main software only from official sources only.
* Either pay for premium features or stick with the software's free features.
* Don't use crack files to activate software licenses.
* Before downloading a file from a third-party, always scan the link from where you're downloading it.
