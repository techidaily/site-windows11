## Unlocking Efficiency: A Guide to Quick RDC in Win 11

 Remote Desktop Connection is Windows 11’s built-in app for connecting to remote computers. You can use it to remotely access another PC, which comes in handy for personal or support-related use. In Windows 11 Professional and Enterprise editions, you can also enable Remote Desktop to set up a host PC for remote computing.

 To connect to a remote PC, you’ll need to open the Remote Desktop Connection tool. Once done, you can then enter the login credentials for the remote PC to connect to it through the Remote Desktop Connection window. As such, let's explore how to enable the Remote Desktop Connection tool on Windows 11

## How to Enable Remote Desktop Connection on Windows 11

 If you want your PC to be a host computer, you’ll need to [enable Remote Desktop](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-set-up-microsofts-remote-desktop-connection/) on that PC's copy of Windows 11\. Note that you can only activate that feature in Enterprise and Professional editions of Microsoft’s latest desktop platform, as is also the case for Windows 10\. You can enable Remote Desktop as follows:

1. Click the taskbar’s **Start** button.
2. Open the **Settings** app that’s pinned to the Start menu.
3. Select the **Remote Desktop** navigation option.
4. Click the **Remote Desktop** option to turn it on.

5. Select the **Confirm** option on the Remote Desktop Settings prompt.
6. As an optional extra, click the small arrow beside the Remote Desktop toggle button. Then select the **Require devices to use Network Level Authentication Connect (Recommended)** option.

 Thereafter, you can connect to your host PC remotely with other computers and mobile devices. To do so, you’ll need to enter the required login credentials for it and enter them into the remote access software. On Windows desktops and laptops, you can do that by opening the built-in Remote Desktop Connection accessory.

5. Now you can click the new desktop shortcut to open Remote Desktop Connection.

 That shortcut will simply open the RDC window. You can also set up a Remote Desktop Connection shortcut for a specific PC. To do that, enter **mstsc.exe /v:PC-name** in the Create Shortcut window’s item location text box. Replace **PC-name** in that item location with the actual name of a PC to connect with.
