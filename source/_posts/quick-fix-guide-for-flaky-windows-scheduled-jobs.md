## Quick-Fix Guide for Flaky Windows Scheduled Jobs

 Task Scheduler is a super handy Windows tool that enables users to set up programs and tasks to execute automatically. This makes it easier than ever before to get jobs done on time.

 If you're having trouble scheduling with this program, check out this guide on how to fix the Task Scheduler on Windows.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 The first thing you should do is restart your computer. This is a simple and effective way to resolve any minor issues with Task Scheduler as it can reset any glitches present in the system. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click**Start** or press the Windows key on your keyboard.
2. Now click the Power button and select**Restart** .

 After restarting the computer, open Task Scheduler to see if the problem has been resolved.

## 2\. Run the System File Checker

 If restarting the computer doesn't solve the issue, you can try running the System File Checker tool to scan any corrupted system files on your computer.

To run an SFC scan, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run Command.
2. Type**cmd** in the text box and press**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** .
3. When UAC prompts on the screen, click**Yes** to grant privileges.

4. In the elevated Command Prompt window, type the following command:  
sfc /scannow
5. Press Enter to execute the command. This will scan your computer for corrupted system files and replace them with the correct ones if any are found.

 Once the process is complete, restart the computer and open Task Scheduler to check if the issue has been resolved.

## 3\. Run a DISM Scan to Restore Missing System Files

 The DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) tool is another great tool for fixing Task Scheduler issues. This tool can help repair any corruption in the Windows image on your computer, allowing it to run smoothly again. To use this method, follow these steps:

1. Run Command Prompt as an administrator (see[how to run Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) for instructions).

1. Click Start and select**Settings** from the pinned items. In case you don't find it, use**Win + I** to open it directly.
2. In the left pane, click**Windows Update** .
