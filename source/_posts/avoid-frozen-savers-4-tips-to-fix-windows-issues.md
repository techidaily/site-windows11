## Avoid Frozen Savers: 4 Tips to Fix Windows Issues

 Just when you’re about to change the screen saver on your Windows device, the system settings start malfunctioning. You realize that the screen saver settings are grayed out—making it hard for you to change your current screen saver.

 Fortunately, we’ve got all the solutions you need. So, let’s dive in and check out the four ways to resolve this issue.

## 1\. Use the Local Group Policy Editor

 The “grayed out screen saver settings” error might be caused by issues that stem from the Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE). So, the best way to tackle the problem is to make some changes in the LGPE.

 However, bear in mind that the LGE is only available on Windows Pro, Enterprise, and Education editions. If you’re using the Home edition, then check out tips on how to [access the LGPE on Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/).

 Let’s now explore how to use the LGPE to resolve the issue at hand:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run command dialog box.
2. Type **gpedit.msc** and press **Enter** to open the LGPE.
3. Navigate to **User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Control Panel > Personalization**.
4. Double-click on the **Enable screen saver** option on the right-hand side.

![Clicking the Enable screen saver option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/clicking-the-enable-screen-saver-option.jpg)

 Check the **Enabled** box on the next screen. From there, click **Apply** and then click **OK**.

 But then how would enabling the “screen saver” option resolve the “grayed out screen saver settings” error?

 As per the description in the LGPE, enabling the “screen saver” option enables the “Screen Saver” section in the Screen Saver Settings window. Simply put, this means enabling this option will ensure that the "screen saver settings" section isn't grayed out.

 Now, let’s explore how to enable another LGPE feature to tackle the “grayed out screen saver settings” error:

1. Open the **LGPE** and navigate to the **Personalization** folder as per the previous steps.
2. Double-click on the **Force specific screen saver** option on the right-hand side.

![Clicking the Force specific screen saver option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/clicking-the-force-specific-screen-saver-option.jpg)

 Check the **Disabled** box, click **Apply**, and then click **OK**.

 So, how does disabling the “Force specific screen saver” option help?

 When the “Force specific screen saver” option is enabled, the drop-down list of screen savers in the "Windows Screen Saver" dialog will be grayed out. This means you won’t be able to change your screen saver, but you may still be able to configure other related settings

 So, by disabling the “Force specific screen saver” feature, the "screen saver" drop-down menu in the Screen Saver Settings window won't be grayed out.

## 2\. Use the Registry Editor

![Using a Windows laptop on a brown desk](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Using-a-Windows-laptop-on-a-brown-desk.jpg)

 Now, we’ll show you how to get rid of the “grayed out screen saver settings” error using the Registry Editor. But if you tweak the wrong Registry keys by mistake, your device might end up crashing. That’s why we always recommend that you [back up the Registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before editing its keys.

 Let’s now check out how this tool can help you resolve the issue at hand:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run command dialog box.
2. Type **Regedit** and press **Enter** to open the Registry Editor.
3. Copy-paste the following command into the address bar and press **Enter**:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows

 Next, click the **Control Panel** key (folder) from the options within the "Windows" key.

![Clicking the Control Panel key](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/clicking-the-control-panel-key.jpg)

 If the "Control Panel" key is missing, here’s how you can create it:

1. Right-click on the **Windows** folder (key) in the LGPE and select **New > Key**.
2. Name the key **Control Panel** and press **Enter**.

 Once you’re inside the "Control Panel" key, navigate to the right-hand side and locate the **ScreenSaveActive** option.

![Clicking the ScreenSaveActive option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/clicking-the-screensaveactive-option.jpg)

 If this value is missing, create it through these steps:

1. Right-click on a blank space and select **New > DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
2. Name the value as **ScreenSaveActive** and press **Enter**.

 The “ScreenSaveActive” option in the Registry Editor performs the same function as the “Enable screen saver” option in the LGPE. Remember, enabling the “Enable screen saver option” in the LGPE ensures that the settings on the Screen Saver Settings window aren’t grayed out.

 To enable the “ScreenSaveActive” option in the Registry Editor, double-click on this option and then set the "Value data" as **1**. From there, press **OK** and then restart your device to save the changes.

## 3\. Change the Power Settings

 You might not be aware of this, but configuring the power settings usually has an effect on the other system settings.

 For example, if you enable power-saving mode, then your device will pause some tasks in an effort to save power. But enabling some power-saving features might end up graying out some settings and tools.

 Now, let's check out how to configure a few power settings to tackle the “grayed out screen saver settings” issue.

### Change the Power Settings Via the Screen Saver Settings Window

 Did you know that you can tweak the power settings directly from the Screen Saver Settings window? Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Type **Change screen saver** in the Start menu search bar and select the **Best match**. This should open the Screen Saver Settings window.
2. Scroll down to the **Power management** section.
3. Click the **Change power settings** option.

![Clicking the Change power settings option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/clicking-the-change-power-settings-option.jpg)

 Select the **Change plan settings** option on the "Power Options" screen. This will display the "Edit Plan Settings" screen.

 From there, follow these steps:

1. Locate the **Turn off the display** and **Put computer to sleep** options.
2. Click the drop-down menus next to these options and select **Never** for all the options.
3. Click the **Save Changes** button.

 Simply navigate to the "Power Options" screen as per the previous steps and then click the **Restore plan defaults** button. Finally, click **Apply** and then click **OK**.

### Change the Power Settings via the Control Panel

 In some rare instances, you might not be able to access the power settings via the Screen Saver Settings window. So, this means you’d have to configure the power settings directly via the Control Panel.

 Let's take you through the steps you should follow:
