 So close the troubleshooter and restart your computer. Then try updating Windows again and check if the failed update gets installed.

## 2\. Temporarily Disable Your Antivirus Software

 Your antivirus may have options to disable it temporarily. Or right-click on the Windows icon on the taskbar and select**Task Manager** .

 In**Task Manager** , click the**Startup** tab and look for your antivirus software. Then, right-click on it and choose**Disable** .

Try updating Windows now and see if the update gets installed.

## 3\. Run the System File Checker and the DISM Tool

 Corrupted Windows system files could also be the cause of the 0x800f0845 error. To scan, repair, and replace such damaged files, run the System File Checker or SFC scan.

 And if the SFC doesn't work properly, and can’t repair your system files, you should run the DISM or Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool. DISM is a command-line tool that can be used to service and repair Windows images, including those used for Windows Recovery and Windows Setup.

 To know how to run the SFC and DSIM, you can explore our guide on [CHKSDK, SFC, and DISM, and how they work](https://www.makeuseof.com/difference-between-chkdsk-sfc-and-dism-in-windows-10/) .

 These scans will take a few minutes to run. If the 0x800f0845 error was caused by corrupted files, it should have been fixed. So try updating Windows again.

net stop wuauserv  
net stop appidsvc

 Then to set up a new SoftwareDistribution folder, you need to rename it. So enter the following command and press**enter** :
