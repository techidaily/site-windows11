## Fixing IntelliJ Unison Not Working: A Guide for Users of Windows 11

 Intel Unison is an excellent app for connecting your Android or iPhone to your Windows 11 computer. However, like any other app, Intel Unison isn't devoid of issues. If you rely on Intel Unison to read text messages and answer phone calls from your computer, it can be inconvenient when the app stops working properly.

 If you, too, are having trouble using the Intel Unison app on Windows, here are some troubleshooting tips that’ll help.

## 1\. Run the Windows Store Apps and Bluetooth Troubleshooters

 The Windows Store Apps and Bluetooth troubleshooters can automatically detect and fix issues with Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps and your Bluetooth devices on your PC. You can try running these tools and see if that gets the Intel Unison app working again.

To run the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter:

1. Open the**Start menu** and click the**gear-shaped icon** to [launch the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
2. In the**System** tab, click on**Troubleshoot** .
3. Select**Other troubleshooters** .
4. Click the**Run** button next to**Windows Store Apps** .

5. Next, click the**Run** button next to**Bluetooth** .

 Follow the on-screen prompts to run the troubleshooters and then try using the Intel Unison app.

## 2\. Allow the Intel Unison App to Run in the Background

 If you’ve disabled background app permission for Intel Unison, it may fail to sync your data when you are not using it. To avoid this, you must enable background app permission for the Intel Unison app. Here's how to do it.

1. Right-click on the Start icon or press**Win + X** to open the Power User menu.
2. Select**Installed apps** from the list.
3. Scroll through the list or use the search tool to locate the**Intel Unison** app. Then, click the**three-dot menu icon** next to it and select**Advanced options** .

## 4\. Turn Off Battery Saver Mode

 When you enable battery saver mode, Windows pauses background app activities on your computer. While this is a great way to [improve battery life on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-improve-battery-life/) , it may prevent apps like Intel Unison from working efficiently.

 To avoid any performance issues, it's best to turn off battery saver mode on Windows. Here’s how you can go about it:

1. Press**Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. In the**System** tab, click on**Power & battery** .
3. Under Battery, click on**Battery saver** and click the**Turn off now** button.

## 5\. Disable Any Active Third-Party Antivirus Programs

 At times, third-party antivirus programs on your PC can get too cautious and prevent apps from exchanging files and syncing data. To check for this possibility, you need to temporarily disable your antivirus program.

 You can typically do this by right-clicking the antivirus program’s icon in the system tray and selecting**Disable until next restart** . However, the instructions will differ between antivirus programs, so if you're stuck, check your antivirus' official help documentation for instructions.

 Once disabled, try using the Intel Unison app again. If this solves your problem, you can go through your antivirus program’s settings and whitelist the Intel Unison app.

## 6\. Disconnect and Reconnect Your Phone

 Connection issues between the Intel Unison app and your phone can also cause the app to stop working on Windows. In most cases, you should be able to resolve such issues by disconnecting and reconnecting your phone.

 This should re-establish the connection between Windows and your phone, resolving any issues caused by misconfigured settings.

 To disconnect your phone from the Intel Unison app, follow these steps:

1. Open the Intel Unison app on your PC.
2. Click the**computer icon** in the top left corner and select**Manage my devices** .
3. Click the**Forget this device** option.
4. Next, open the Intel Unison app on your Android or iPhone and scan the QR code on your PC.
