## Camouflage Linguistic Separator on Win11 Status Bar

 Have you noticed the Windows 11 language bar hanging around your taskbar? It's a feature that some may wish to get rid of, especially if you have no plans to change which language you type in anytime soon.

 Let's have a look at how to hide the language bar from Windows 11.

## What Is the Language Bar?

 The language bar is a small icon on your taskbar, usually indicated by a three-letter language code—for example, ENG for English.

 It allows the user to quickly switch between different keyboard layouts. If you have more than one keyboard layout or language added to Windows 11, the language bar will show up in the bottom right corner of your screen.

 If you're unfamiliar with this functionality, consider reading up on [how to install different languages and layouts in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-add-change-keyboard-layouts/) before you remove it. It's a handy feature for those who type in multiple languages, but the average user might struggle to find a use for it.

 The language bar is most easily removed by ensuring you only have one keyboard language installed.

 You can check how many languages you have installed by searching**Edit Language** in the start menu's search bar.

 You'll want to open**Edit Language and Keyboard Options.**

 If the language bar doesn't disappear, there's another way to remove it.

 Search**Advanced Keyboard Options** in the start menu search bar. Open this system settings window and tick**Use the desktop language bar when it's available.** Then, click into**Language bar options.**

![screenshot of advanced keyboard settings in windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/screenshot_of_advanced_keyboard_settings_language_bar_options.jpg)

 Tick the**Hidden** option underneath the**Language Bar** title, then hit**Apply** . This will prevent the language bar from showing in any capacity.

## A Useful Tool Not Many Users Need

 The language bar is perhaps more difficult to hide than it should be. For some users, the language bar shows even if the user only has one language installed.

 Thankfully, it can still be removed or hidden regardless. If you've never used this feature, enjoy the small amount of extra space gained on your taskbar by removing it.
