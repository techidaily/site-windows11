## No More Confusion: Selecting Ideal Drives for Gameplay

 The Xbox app lets you purchase and install games on any of your system drives. Usually, this process works well, but sometimes, the Xbox app won't let you install games in any location other than the default directory. This can be problematic, especially when you want to install a big-size game, but the default directory doesn't have enough space.

 Such situations usually arise due to corruption in the Xbox app or misconfigured registry settings. Fortunately, it's very easy to troubleshoot this problem. Here are some fixes to try when you can't choose a drive to install games on the Xbox app.

## 1\. Restart the Computer

 You might fail to change the installation drive in the Xbox app due to a temporary system glitch or bug. Luckily, you can quickly eliminate such bugs and glitches by restarting your computer.

 To restart, press the**Alt + F4** hotkeys to open the Shut Down Windows prompt, click the drop-down icon, choose**Restart** from the context menu, and then click**OK.** After restart, launch the Xbox app and check if you can choose a different drive to install games. If not, then it's time to dive into the advanced troubleshooting methods.

## 2\. Change the Installation Directory in the Xbox App Settings

 There are two places from where you can change the installation drive on the Xbox app. One is while installing the game, whereas the other is the Xbox settings menu.

 If the first method is not working, you can use the second method to change the installation drive in the Xbox app. So, here's how to edit the Xbox app settings to change its default download location.

1. Launch the Xbox app, click on your profile in the top left corner, and choose**Settings** from the context menu.
2. Choose**General** from the left sidebar.
3. Click the**Change folder** option under**Change where this app installs games by default** .

4. Choose the location where you want to install the game and then click the**Select Folder** option.

## 5\. Reinstall the Gaming Services App

 The solution, in this case, is to reinstall the Gaming Services app on your computer. You can do that by following the below instructions:

 Editing the registry can be dangerous, as one wrong edit can make your system unstable. To ensure that your data is secure even if something goes wrong,[back up the registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) .

1. Open the Run dialog box, type**regedit,** and click OK.
2. In the Registry Editor, navigate to the below location:  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services`

## 6\. Repair the Xbox App

 It's very common for the Xbox app to get corrupt and throw various issues. The best way to remove corruption from the UWP apps like the Xbox app is to use the Windows repair feature.

 Check out[how to repair apps and programs on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-repair-apps-programs/) for information on how to do this.

## 7\. Update the Xbox App

 If repairing the Xbox app doesn't remove the corruption, consider updating the app. Downloading the latest update of the Xbox app will not only remove the corruption but also introduce new features.

To update the Xbox app, follow the below steps:

1. Open the Microsoft Store and click the**Library** option in the left sidebar.
2. Click the**Get updates** button to allow the Microsoft Store to search for available updates of the installed apps.

 The Microsoft Store will now automatically download updates for installed apps, including the Xbox app.

 While you're at installing updates, we'd also recommend[downloading any available Windows updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-windows-software-guide/) . To do so, launch the Settings app, choose**Windows Update** from the left sidebar, and then click the**Check for Updates** button to install any available update on your computer. Following this, you will be able to choose a drive to install games on the Xbox app.
