## 3\. Allow Phone Link App to Run in the Background

 On Windows, you can block specific apps from running in the background and using system resources. If you have previously restricted the Phone Link app from working in the background, it will fail to sync notifications. As a result, you won't receive any notifications for calls, messages, or other app alerts.

 To fix this, you must allow background app permissions for the Phone Link app. Here's how to do it.

1. Right-click on the**Start icon** and select**Settings** from the list.
2. Select**Apps** from the left sidebar.
3. Click on**Installed apps** .
4. Scroll down or use the search bar at the top to locate the**Phone Link** app on the list.
5. Click the**three-dot menu icon** next to the app and select**Advanced options** .
6. Click the drop-down menu under**Background apps permissions** and choose**Always** .

 It's worth noting that Windows might activate the battery saver mode automatically if the battery level falls below 20 percent. To prevent this, keep your laptop connected to a power source while using the Phone Link app.

## 5\. Disable Do Not Disturb Mode

To disable the Do Not Disturb mode, use these steps:

1. Open the**Start menu** and click the**gear-shaped icon** to launch the Settings app.
2. Navigate to**System > Notifications** .
3. Turn off the toggle next to**Do not distrub** .
4. Expand the**Turn on do not disturb automatically** and clear all the checkboxes.
