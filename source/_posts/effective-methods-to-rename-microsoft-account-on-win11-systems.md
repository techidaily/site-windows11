## 3\. How to Change the Administrator Name Through Command Prompt

 If you prefer using the Command Prompt instead of the Settings app or Control Panel, you can also change your Microsoft account administrator name through it. This is a command line interpreter tool that allows you to control your Windows computer system with instructions.

 To change the Microsoft account administrator name through Command Prompt, follow these steps:

1. [Run the Command Prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) .
