## The Ultimate Fixer's Handbook for Recurring Rainmeter Glitches

 Rainmeter lets you personalize your Windows desktop with unique skins and widgets. It helps in tweaking everything from clock skins to system resource usage widgets.

 However, if you're new to this tool and struggling with issues like Rainmeter not opening or crashing frequently, you're not alone. Let's look at several troubleshooting methods to solve any Rainmeter issues on Windows.

## Common Rainmeter Problems on Windows

 There are various issues that a newbie may experience while setting up Rainmeter. This guide will provide several general ways to fix common errors. These errors include:

1. Rainmeter refusing to open in Windows.
2. Rainmeter crashes without warning, and at seemingly random times.
3. Rainmeter freezing when you apply a skin.
4. Finally, Rainmeter sometimes does not run when you boot up Windows.

 If you're encountering any of the above, let's hop into the fixes.

## 1\. Try Out Some General Fixes

 We recommend trying out the below fixes if Rainmeter is not working correctly on Windows:

* **Restart your system:** A system restart can clear out any temporary data that might be causing Rainmeter to crash.
* **Launch Rainmeter as an administrator:** Before troubleshooting the main issue, try running Rainmeter with administrative permissions. To do so, click the search icon and type **Rainmeter**.Then, choose the **Run as administrator** option.  
![Rainmeter Windows Search Results](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rainmeter-search-results.jpg)
* **Uninstall a recently applied skin:** Have you recently installed a Rainmeter skin onto your desktop? It is possible that the skin may be the root cause of all your issues. To check this, uninstall the skin and restart Rainmeter.

 After applying the general fixes, check if Rainmeter is functioning normally.

## 2\. Update Rainmeter to the Latest Version

 You've tried the general fixes, but Rainmeter is still causing trouble. What's the next step, then? It could be as simple as updating Rainmeter to its latest version.

 Here’s how you can update Rainmeter to its latest version:

1. Open your browser and visit [Rainmeter.net](https://www.rainmeter.net/).
2. On the home page, click the **Download** button.  
![Rainmeter Website Overview](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rainmeter-website-overview.jpg)
3. Run the **Rainmeter.exe** file from your **Downloads** folder.
4. Click **OK** to proceed with the installation.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to overwrite the current Rainmeter version with the latest one.

## 3\. Disable the Rainmeter Skins Temporarily

 Rainmeter is best known for its compatibility with [multiple third-party skins](https://www.makeuseof.com/rainmeter-weather-skins/). But what if the skin you're trying to install is the culprit behind the frequent Rainmeter crashes? To check, disable the skins currently active on your desktop.

 We suggest turning off the skins individually and taking note of the order in which you unload them. This will help you point out the corrupted skin.

 Follow the below-given steps to disable all the Rainmeter skins temporarily:

1. Right-click on your applied skin and click on **Manage skin**.  
![Rainmeter Manage Skin Option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rainmeter-manage-skin-option.jpg)
2. Within the **Manage** window, locate the **Active Skins** tab.
3. Under this tab, you'll find a list of all active skins. Click on **Unload** for each active skin's components.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 After performing these steps, run Rainmeter and observe if the issues persist. If it runs smoothly, you can start reenabling the disabled skins.

 Overall, the skins enhance your Windows desktop's aesthetics and functionality. However, a poorly coded one can sometimes cause unexpected glitches and crashes. So, don't let a skin ruin your overall desktop experience.

## 4\. Adjust Rainmeter Startup Settings

 Another workaround for your Rainmeter-related issues is by adjusting its startup settings. If Rainmeter is not opening as soon as you unlock your PC after a boot, set the app to start up on every boot.

 Here's how you can adjust Rainmeter's startup settings:

1. [Launch the Windows Task Manager app](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-access-task-manager-on-windows-11/).
2. Open the **Startup apps** tab from the left-hand sidebar.
3. Under the **Name** entries, right-click on **Rainmeter** and select **Enable**.  
![Rainmeter Startup Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rainmeter-startup-settings.jpg)
4. Restart your computer after adjusting the startup settings.

 That's it. These steps should ensure that Rainmeter starts up smoothly with Windows without causing any delay in loading your currently applied skin.

## 5\. Turn Off Hardware Acceleration

 Rainmeter sometimes runs slowly or not as efficient as you'd expect. This issue might be due to a Windows feature called Hardware Acceleration.

 The [Hardware Acceleration](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-hardware-acceleration/) feature uses your PC's GPU (alongside the CPU) to handle the ongoing processes (tasks) in a better way. But sometimes, instead of enhancing the performance, it can lead to performance issues. So, if you're experiencing issues with Rainmeter's performance, consider disabling hardware acceleration for now.

 Here's a tip: A quick way to turn off hardware acceleration for Rainmeter is from its settings window. Navigate to **Rainmeter > Manage > Settings** and uncheck the **Use hardware acceleration** option.

 If you're not in a position to use its settings (because of crashes), try the alternative method using the steps below:

1. Open the Windows search bar, type **Graphics settings**, and click **Open**.
2. Click the **Browse** button and select the **Rainmeter.exe** file. This file is mainly located inside the **C:\\Program Files\\Rainmeter** directory.  
![Rainmeter Folder Preview](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rainmeter-folder-preview.jpg)
3. Once Rainmeter appears in the list, click on **Options**.
4. Change the **Graphics preference** to **Power Saving**.
5. Click **Save** to finalize the changes and relaunch Rainmeter to check whether the issues have been resolved.

 If turning off hardware acceleration doesn't fix your issue, enable it back from the same settings and proceed to the following method.

## 6\. Clean Install Rainmeter

 If none of the above steps help fix Rainmeter issues, a clean installation is the last resort. A clean installation means uninstalling the app first and then reinstalling it correctly. Once you clean install Rainmeter, it should remove any corrupted or misconfigured files.

 Updating Rainmeter is different from clean installing it. After an update, it mainly bumps the version of the software and doesn't usually affect the core files. At the same time, a clean installation removes all the related app data and settings. So, ensure you do not skip this method!

 For uninstalling Rainmeter, we recommend using the [free version of Revo Uninstaller](https://www.revouninstaller.com/). Download it from the given link and use it to remove Rainmeter properly. If you don't want to rely on a third-party app, follow our [how to uninstall Rainmeter](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-rainmeter-clean-uninstall/) guide for an alternate way.

 Once you're done with the previous step, download Rainmeter or run the **EXE** file you've downloaded before (at the time of updating Rainmeter).

 Next, go through the entire setup process again and start Rainmeter. Hopefully, a clean install should do the trick for you and fix all your issues.
