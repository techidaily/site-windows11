 Microsoft Defender SmartScreen is part of the Windows Security solution. It helps you protect against common threats by warning against downloading or installing potentially malicious files from other computers.

 SmartScreen is enabled by default in Windows. However, sometimes, you may want to disable the feature if it identifies and blocks genuine apps and files as malicious. Fortunately, you can disable SmartScreen easily. Here, we show you how to disable the SmartScreen filter in Windows.

## How Does Windows SmartScreen Filter Work?

 SmartScreen relies on reputation-based protection to protect your device from malicious or potentially unwanted apps and websites.

 When enabled, SmartScreen screens your downloads against known suspicious sites and developers. When a match is found, it blocks the download or site access and warns the user about the action taken.

 You can configure it to block apps and files by checking unrecognized apps and files from the web. It can also protect you from Microsoft Store and third-party sourced apps that are low on reputation and known to cause unexpected behavior.

[SmartScreen is also part of Microsoft Edge's security settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/guide-to-security-settings-in-microsoft-edge/). When enabled, it helps protect your computer against malicious and phishing sites and block downloads.

 SmartScreen is enabled by default on all the Windows OS running systems. However, some experienced users may find the feature annoying as it can block safe apps, requiring additional steps to run the setup.

 While we recommend you always turn the SmartScreen filter on, you can disable it easily from the Windows Security settings. Here's how to do it.

## 1\. How to Turn Off SmartScreen Using Windows' Security Settings

 The easiest way to turn off SmartScreen is via the Windows Settings panel. You can configure all the aspects of your system security from the Windows Security panel. Here's how to do it.

Make sure to enable the SmartScreen filter once the task is finished.

 Microsoft Defender SmartScreen is part of the Windows Security solution. It helps you protect against common threats by warning against downloading or installing potentially malicious files from other computers.

 SmartScreen is enabled by default in Windows. However, sometimes, you may want to disable the feature if it identifies and blocks genuine apps and files as malicious. Fortunately, you can disable SmartScreen easily. Here, we show you how to disable the SmartScreen filter in Windows.

## How Does Windows SmartScreen Filter Work?

 SmartScreen relies on reputation-based protection to protect your device from malicious or potentially unwanted apps and websites.

 When enabled, SmartScreen screens your downloads against known suspicious sites and developers. When a match is found, it blocks the download or site access and warns the user about the action taken.

 You can configure it to block apps and files by checking unrecognized apps and files from the web. It can also protect you from Microsoft Store and third-party sourced apps that are low on reputation and known to cause unexpected behavior.

[SmartScreen is also part of Microsoft Edge's security settings](https://www.makeuseof.com/guide-to-security-settings-in-microsoft-edge/). When enabled, it helps protect your computer against malicious and phishing sites and block downloads.

 SmartScreen is enabled by default on all the Windows OS running systems. However, some experienced users may find the feature annoying as it can block safe apps, requiring additional steps to run the setup.

 While we recommend you always turn the SmartScreen filter on, you can disable it easily from the Windows Security settings. Here's how to do it.

## 1\. How to Turn Off SmartScreen Using Windows' Security Settings
