## Fuchsia Fiasco? Solutions to Reclaiming a Standard Desktop Display

 In some cases, restarting your Windows device could help. Perform any one of the many[ways to restart a Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) and see if that fixes this.

## 2\. Restart File Explorer

Let’s take a look at the steps for restarting File Explorer:
