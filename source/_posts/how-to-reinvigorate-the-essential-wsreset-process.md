## How to Reinvigorate the Essential WSReset Process

 WSReset.exe is an essential command line tool delivered with Windows to perform various tasks and troubleshoot issues. It resets the Windows application store and clears cache issues that may result in slow performance or errors.

 However, if you encounter problems with WSReset.exe or receive frequent errors, your computer may have an underlying issue that needs to be addressed. This article offers guidance on troubleshooting and fixing WSReset.

## How to Fix WSReset.exe Not Working on Windows

 Before you troubleshoot, let's see what WSReset.exe is used for. The WSReset.exe program resets Windows Store and clears any cache issues that might cause errors. It troubleshoots problems with the Windows Store and applications, including those that are not downloading or launching properly.

 Now let's move on to troubleshooting.

## 1\. Run WSReset.exe as an Administrator

 WSReset.exe requires administrative privileges to run properly. If you're not running it as an administrator, it may fail to reset the Windows Store cache.

 To resolve this issue, [ensure you're using a Windows admin account](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-windows-account-admin-rights/), then try running WSReset.exe again.

## 2\. Run the Windows Store App Troubleshooter

 This problem also appears due to corrupt system files or Windows Store application issues. To fix these issues, Windows offers an embedded troubleshooter that identifies and resolves problems with the Store app.

 To run the troubleshooter, use the steps below.

1. Press **Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.
2. Select **System** from the left sidebar.
3. In the right pane, click **Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters**.
