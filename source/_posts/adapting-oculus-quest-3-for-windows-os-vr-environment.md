## Adapting Oculus Quest 3 for Windows OS VR Environment

 Many people get the Oculus Quest 2 because it’s a standalone virtual reality (VR) headset that doesn't require a beefy PC to run. However, you can still effectively turn a Quest 2 into an Oculus Rift Windows PC VR headset and open up a whole new world of virtual reality.

 Turning the Oculus Quest 2 into a Windows PC VR headset will enable you to access the full Oculus Rift library of apps and manage them from your computer. This is how you can transform the Oculus Quest 2 into a Windows PC VR headset.

## What You’ll Need to Utilize Oculus Link on Windows

 Oculus Link is a handy app that lets you connect and power an Oculus Quest 2 headset with your PC. This tool enables users to install Oculus VR apps on their PCs’ storage drives. Installed VR apps utilize the PC’s processor rather than the Oculus Quest 2's one, so you can enjoy PC VR software in Oculus Quest 2 much the same as the Oculus Rift.

 However, not all PCs are compatible with the Oculus Quest 2 headset. You’ll need a VR-ready PC to utilize Oculus Link. Most VR-ready PCs are advertised as such, and some have stickers stuck on them to highlight their VR readiness.

 If you’re not sure about your computer’s VR compatibility, have a look at your PC’s page on its manufacturer’s website for further details. This [Meta Quest Link compatibility](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/meta-quest-link-compatibility/) webpage also includes minimum PC system requirement info.

 You’ll also need a long link cable for connecting the Oculus Quest 2 to your desktop or laptop. There is an alternative wireless Air Link option, but here we’re looking at how to connect headsets with a cable.

## How to Download and Install the Oculus Windows Software

 The only other thing you’ll need aside from the VR-ready PC and Oculus Link cable is the Oculus Desktop software for Windows. Oculus Desktop is freely available software with which you can connect Oculus headsets and manage your PC VR apps in Windows 11/10\. It’s big software that consumes about 9.26 gigabytes of drive space. You can download and install the Oculus app as follows:

1. Open the [Meta Quest 2](https://www.meta.com/gb/quest/setup/?utm%5Fsource=www.meta.com&utm%5Fmedium=dollyredirect) page in a browser.
2. Click the**Download Software** option for the Oculus Quest 2.

## How to Get Into Oculus Dash on the Oculus Quest 2

 When you’ve enabled Quest Link in your headset, you’ll enter a new Oculus Dash home environment. That’s essentially a new user interface in which you can browse the Oculus Rift store from which to download/install apps for your Quest 2\. Press the**Store** button to bring up the Oculus Rift storefront.

![The Oculus Rift Store in Dash](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/oculus-rift-storefront.jpg)

 Now you’ll have the Oculus Rift store at your fingertips on your Oculus Quest 2\. There you can download and install VR apps that will be stored on your PC’s hard drive. Download a freely available entertainment app from there to get started.

 These are some of the more noteworthy PC VR entertainment apps and games in the Oculus Rift store you can try out on your Oculus Quest 2:

* [1943 Berlin Blitz](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/2178820058825941/?locale=en%5FGB)
* [Google Earth VR](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1513995308673845/)
* [Oculus Dreamdeck](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/941682542593981/)
* [Elite Dangerous](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/988773191157765/)
* [Brass Tactics](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/rift/1101975213197949/)
* [Asgard's Wrath](https://www.oculus.com/asgards-wrath/?locale=en%5FGB)

 There's more to VR apps than games, though. For instance,[the best Windows virtual reality apps to boost productivity](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-windows-virtual-reality-apps-to-boost-productivity/) can help you get more out of your headset.

 You can run an app by pressing the**Library** button. Then select the**Apps** tab to view the ones you’ve downloaded. Select an app to launch from there with your Quest 2 controller.

![The Library button in Dash](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/library-button.jpg)

 Oculus Dash also has a Home VR feature. That’s a customizable virtual living room you can have some fun in. There you can pick up objects and rearrange the living room as you see fit.

![A screenshot captured in Dash's Home VR feature](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/home-feature-sceenshot.jpg)

 You can access that virtual environment by pressing the**Home** button on the Dash bar. Press the**Menu** button on the left control stick to bring up the menu for customizing the environment. Then select**Inventory** to add new things to the environment from the**Base** ,**Objects** , and**Decorations** tabs on that menu.

![The Home customization menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/home-customize-menu.jpg)

 Virtual Desktop is another notable feature of Dash that enables you to see and access your Windows desktop within the Quest 2 headset – when it works right. However, many users have reported seeing a blank, black screen when they try to utilize that feature.

 When you want to go back to the default Quest 2 home environment, select the**Disable Quest Link** option on the Dash taskbar. You can return to the Dash environment anytime from the Settings dashboard. Select the clock with your controller to enable Quest Link from there.

## Manage Your PC VR App Library from Windows
