4. If you leave the **Start in** field blank, the shortcut will work throughout the Windows environment. If you select a path here, the shortcut will only work when you are in that environment or program.

 To remove a shortcut set up using PowerToys, simply open the utility, navigate to **Keyboard Manager**, select **Remap a shortcut**, and click on the delete button to the right of the specific shortcut you wish to remove.
