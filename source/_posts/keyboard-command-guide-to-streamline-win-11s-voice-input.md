## Keyboard Command Guide to Streamline Win 11'S Voice Input

 Windows 11 comes packed with a number of features that ease your work. One such feature is the voice recorder, which allows you to make recordings quickly and easily. To help you get the most out of this tool, we’ve put together a list of voice recorder keyboard shortcuts for Windows computers.

 With these shortcuts, you can save time and energy when recording without having to use your mouse or touchpad. So, let's get started.

## 1\. Start a New Recording

 The**Ctrl + R** keyboard shortcut is especially useful for voice recorders. It starts a new recording without having to open the application and hit record manually. It's great for speeding up workflows, as it can save significant time when compared to manually starting a recording each time.

 If your recording sounds a little low-quality, it may be time to upgrade your microphone. Fortunately, we have a guide on[what to look for when buying a studio microphone](https://www.makeuseof.com/buying-studio-microphone-what-to-look-for/) to help you pick the right one.

## 2\. Add a New Marker to the Recording

**Ctrl + M** is another useful and intuitive shortcut. It adds a marker to the recording, making it easy to find and reference audio content. Markers allow you to quickly jump between various points in a recording without having to search through large amounts of audio data.

## 3\. Delete the Selected Recording

 There is nothing more helpful in any program than shortcuts, and this is particularly true in Voice Recorder. With the**Delete** shortcut, you can quickly delete unwanted recordings without having to navigate through the menu system.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 To use the shortcut, you need to select the recording you want to delete and then press the**Delete** key. If you see a confirmation pop-up, click**OK** . This will immediately remove the selected recording from your library and free up space for new recordings.

## 4\. Play or Pause

 A simple press of the**Spacebar** lets you play or pause recorded files on your computer, allowing you to control playback easily. This shortcut can help you save time and improve your workflow.

 When a sound file is open in Windows Media Player, hitting the Spacebar once will play it from where it left off. Pressing it again pauses whatever is currently playing; then pressing it again resumes the song from that point forward. With this convenient feature, you can increase your productivity while staying focused on your tasks.

## 5\. Go Back

 The**backspace** key is one of the most essential components of a keyboard. It's used for a variety of applications, including deleting mistakes and navigating menus.

 For recording voice, this key has another important purpose: allowing them to quickly go back and review their recordings without having to start over from the beginning each time.

## 6\. Rename a Recording

 With the help of the**F2** keyboard shortcut, it is easy to rename any recording you have in your library. You can use this shortcut to personalize the titles of your recordings for easier identification and organization. Not only does this help you find specific recordings faster, but it also categorizes related material better.

![Rename a file in Voice Recorder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/rename-a-file-in-voice-recorder.jpg)

 To use this feature, simply choose the desired file, then press F2 on your keyboard. After that, give the file a name and click**Rename** to save it.

## 7\. Show in Folder

 Although the voice recorder is one of the most convenient tools available, navigating your recordings can be difficult if you don't know the[Windows keyboard shortcuts](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-shortcuts-101-ultimate-keyboard-shortcut-guide/) .

 The**O** shortcut lets you locate a recording file on the computer's hard drive and display the folder containing the file quickly and easily.

![Show Recording in Folder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/show-recording-in-folder.jpg)

 To open a folder, select the recording you want to open and then press O – this will launch an Explorer window displaying all of your audio recordings. With this shortcut, you do not have to search through numerous files to find what you need. It takes just one quick keystroke to access all of your recorded audio files!

## 9\. Jump Ahead or Back While Playing a Recording

 With keyboard shortcuts on Windows, you can easily control your voice recordings without having to navigate through a full menu display. The**Right and Left arrows** make it easy to jump ahead or back in your recordings.

 A press of the right arrow on your keyboard will jump you forward by approximately one second in your recording. On the other hand, you can move backward one second at a time by pressing the left arrow.

 This is an especially useful feature when you need to skip over a certain section of your audio file quickly. You can also hold down either key for faster navigation during the playback process.

## 10\. Jump Further Ahead or Back

 The**Shift Right** and**Shift Left** arrow keys are two of the most useful shortcuts that allow you to jump further ahead or back in your recordings. It can be extremely useful for making edits or quickly finding a portion of the recording.

 Using the shift right arrow key will take you forward 5 seconds at a time while using the shift left arrow key will take you backward. It is especially helpful when dealing with long blocks of audio since it eliminates the need to scroll around in the timeline bar.
