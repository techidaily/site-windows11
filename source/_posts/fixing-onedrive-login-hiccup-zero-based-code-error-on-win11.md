## Fixing OneDrive Login Hiccup: Zero-Based Code Error on Win11

 Microsoft's cloud storage service OneDrive simplifies file management on Windows. However, you might experience issues when signing in to OneDrive, like the 0x8004dec5 error. This article will guide you on how to resolve OneDrive sign-in error 0x8004dec5 specifically on Windows 11\.

## 1\. Check Your Internet Connection

 If you’re having trouble signing in to OneDrive, first [check your internet connection](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-check-wifi-network-strength/). Slow or spotty internet causes sign-in problems. So, check your connection speed and make sure it’s strong enough for OneDrive. If necessary, reset your router or modem to restore the connection.

 If your internet connection is working, restart your computer and sign in to OneDrive again. This simple step fixes minor errors in the operating system that may cause the sign-in issue.

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity`
5. Right-click on the **Identity** folder and select **Delete** from the menu.
