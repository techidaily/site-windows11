## Mastering Files: 6 Methods to Retrieve Windows 11 Paths

 A path is the location of a file or folder in Windows 11\. All paths incorporate the folders you need to open to reach a specific location. Users used to frequently enter folder and file paths in the old days of command-based operating systems, such as DOS.

 Today, users can navigate through folders within Windows File Explorer without inputting change directory commands. However, it can still be useful to copy file and folder paths so you can paste it into documents, the Command Prompt, or when opening something within an app. Here are some ways you can copy file and folder paths in Windows 11\.

## 1\. How to Copy Paths With Explorer’s "See More" Menu

 File Explorer’s **See more menu** includes a **Copy path** option that you can select. Clicking that option for a selected file or folder will copy its path to the clipboard. This is how you can select the **Copy path** option in Windows 11 File Explorer:

1. Select the pinned **File Explorer** shortcut on the Windows taskbar.
2. Open a folder that includes a subfolder or file for which you want to copy a path.
3. Click once on the subfolder or file to select it.
4. Then click the **See more** button with the three dots on Explorer’s command bar.

5. Select the **Copy path** option.

 Then [open Notepad](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-notepad/) or a word processor to paste the copied path. You can paste in copied paths by pressing the **Ctrl** \+ **V** hotkey. The paths you copy with this method will include the full location within inverted commas.

## 2\. How to Select the Default Context Menu Option for Copying Paths

 Alternatively, you can select a **Copy as path** option via Explorer’s context menu. To do so, open up a directory that includes a file or folder path to copy. Then right-click the file or folder and select **Copy as path**.

![The Copy as path option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/copy-as-path.jpg)

 You can also copy multiple paths. To do so, select multiple files and folders by holding the **Ctrl** key. Then right-click one to select **Copy as path**.

## 3\. How to Copy Paths With a Hotkey

 More recent Windows 11 build versions from 22463 up include a convenient hotkey for copying paths. You can copy paths with that keyboard shortcut by selecting folders or files in Explorer and pressing the **Ctrl** \+ **Shift** \+ **C** key combination.

 That’s the hotkey for the **Copy as path** context menu option. You can see if your Windows 11 build version has that hotkey by right-clicking a file or folder. That hotkey won’t work if you can’t see **Ctrl** \+ **Shift** \+ **C** beside the **Copy as path** option on the context menu.

 If your Windows 11 version doesn’t have that hotkey, you’ll need to update the platform. You can do that with one of the methods in our guide about [manually updating Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/#:~:text=Press%20the%20Win%20%2B%20I%20hotkeys,the%20Check%20for%20updates%20button.). Select to install the latest build of the platform if you’re utilizing an older version.

## 4\. How to Copy Paths With File Explorer’s Address Bar Options

 File Explorer’s address bar includes the paths of folders you open. You can copy paths from there by selecting an option on the address bar’s context menu. Open a folder for which to copy the location. Then right-click in the address bar and select **Copy address as text**.

![The Copy address as text option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/copy-address-as-plain-text-option.jpg)

 The **Copy address as text** option copies the folder path in the address bar as plain text. The pasted copied path will not include any inverted commas (quote marks).

## 5\. How to Copy Target Paths for Shortcuts

 This method will be useful if you ever need to open the source folder for a desktop shortcut. The properties windows for desktop paths have **Target** boxes that include the paths of the application files they launch. You can copy the paths for desktop shortcuts from those boxes.

![The Target box](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/target-box.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 To copy a target path, right-click a desktop shortcut and select **Properties**; click inside the **Target** box on the **Shortcut** tab to select the path’s text. Press the standard **Ctrl** \+ **C** hotkey to copy the selected path text. Then paste that copied path into File Explorer’s address bar with **Ctrl** \+ **V**.

## 6\. How to Copy Paths With the Path Copy Copy Software

 Path Copy Copy is third-party software that adds new context menu options for copying paths to File Explorer’s context menu. Users can then select alternative options for copying locations differently on the **Path Copy** submenu. You can copy full paths with that software’s context menu submenu as follows:

1. Open this [Path Copy Copy](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/OS-Enhancements/Path-Copy-Copy.shtml) download page and download the executable, then run it.
2. Click on the **Install for me only** option.
3. Choose **English** (or another preferred alternative) on the **Language** drop-down menu and select **OK**.
4. Click the **I accept the agreement** option and select **Install**.

5. Then you’ll be prompted to restart Windows to complete installation. Select the **Yes, restart the computer now** radio button.

1. Log back into the Windows user account in which you installed the software.
2. Open a folder in File Explorer.
3. Then right-click on a file or subfolder and select **Show more options** on Windows 11’s context menu.
4. Move the cursor over the **Path Copy** subfolder.  
![The Path Copy submenu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/path-copy-submenu.jpg)
5. Select the **Long path** option to copy the full location. Now you’ve copied a long path for pasting anywhere you need.

 The great thing about Path Copy Copy is that it provides many more options for copying folders and file paths. However, only a few of them are on the **Copy Path** submenu to default. To add all options, click **Settings** on the **Path Copy** submenu. Then select all the submenu checkboxes in the window and click **Apply** \> **OK**.

![The Path Copy Copy window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/path-copy-copy-window.jpg)

 Now right-click a file or folder to have another look at the Path Copy submenu, which will include many more options. You can select the **Short** option to copy the location with a shortened folder or file name. Or select **Name** to copy just a title for a file or folder. Try out the different copy path options by selecting them and pasting them into Notepad.

 You can configure how the paths get copied by changing settings within Path Copy Copy’s **Options** tab. For example, your copied paths will include quote marks around them if you select the **Add quotes around copied paths** checkbox. Select the **Add < and > around copied paths** option to include brackets around copied brackets.

## Copy Paths on Windows Whichever Way You Like Best

 Copying and pasting folder and file paths with the methods above will save you from manually typing them whenever needed. File Explorer’s default options for copying paths will probably be sufficient for most users. However, the Path Copy Copy software gives you more options for copying folder and file locations.

 Today, users can navigate through folders within Windows File Explorer without inputting change directory commands. However, it can still be useful to copy file and folder paths so you can paste it into documents, the Command Prompt, or when opening something within an app. Here are some ways you can copy file and folder paths in Windows 11\.
