### 2\. Turn Off Tips and Suggestions Using a REG File

 If the system setting is unresponsive, you can use a REG file instead. This procedure creates a REG file with the necessary commands. Although it may seem complex, it is actually quite simple.

 Here are the steps to follow:

1. [Open the Notepad application](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-notepad/).
2. Copy and paste the following code into it:  
`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ContentDeliveryManager]  
"SubscribedContent-338389Enabled"=dword:00000000`
3. Now save the file with the **.reg** extension.
4. Double-click on the file you just created to open it, and click **Yes** in the confirmation dialog box that appears.

 This will turn off tips and suggestions notifications in Windows 11\. To enable these notifications once again, delete the file you just created. Alternatively, double-click on it and click **No** in the confirmation dialog.

## How to Disable Tips and Suggestions Notifications in Windows 11

 If you prefer to disable tips and suggestions notifications on your computer completely, there are several options available. You can utilize the Group Policy Editor, modify the registry editor, or create a REG file. Let's explore each method in detail to disable this feature.

### 1\. Disable Tips and Suggestions Notifications Using Group Policy Editor

 To turn off notifications for tips and suggestions, access the Group Policy Editor. This tool is available for Windows Pro, Education, and Enterprise users. However, it won't work if you use Windows Home Edition.

 In such cases, you must first [activate the Group Policy Editor for Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/). Once done, follow the steps below to disable notifications for tips and suggestions:

3. On the left side of the window, navigate to the following path:  
Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Cloud Content​
4. On the right side of the window, double-click on the **Do not show Windows tips** policy.

5. From the box that appears, select the **Enabled** radio button.
6. Click **Apply** \> **OK** to save the changes.

 Now, tips and suggestions notifications will be completely disabled on your computer. To re-enable the feature, follow the same steps and select the **Not Configured** or **Disabled** radio button instead.

### 2\. Disable Tips and Suggestions Notifications Using the Registry Editor

 If you can’t access the Group Policy Editor or activate it, you can modify the registry editor to disable these notifications. The procedure is slightly more technical and requires caution while making changes. It may even wreck your computer system, so proceed cautiously.

 To avoid risks, [create a registry backup](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) first. That way, you can restore the original settings if required. Once you have taken these precautionary steps, follow the instructions below to disable tips and suggestions notifications:

1. Press the **Windows** key to open the Start Menu.
2. Type **regedit** in the search box and select the **Registry Editor** app from the search results.
3. If the UAC window appears, click **Yes** to grant permission.
4. In the Registry Editor window, navigate to the following path:  
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CloudContent
5. If the **CloudContent** key is missing, create a new one. To do this, right-click on the Windows folder and select **New** \> **Key**. Name it **CloudContent**.
6. On the right side of the window, right-click on an empty area and select **New** \> **DWORD (32-bit) Value**.
7. Name the value **DisableSoftLanding** and hit Enter.

9. Click **OK** to save the changes. Now, exit the registry editor window and restart your computer.

 After restarting, tips and suggestions notifications will be disabled on your computer. If you want to enable the feature, follow the same steps and change the Value data to **0**.

### 3\. Disable Tips and Suggestions Notifications Using a REG File

 You can also create a REG file to turn off tips and suggestions notifications on your Windows PC. This method is quite similar to the one we discussed above. However, the process is easier for those with little experience editing registry files.

 To disable tips and suggestions notifications using a REG file, follow the steps outlined below:

1. Search for **Notepad** and select the result from the list.
2. Copy and paste the code below into the Notepad window.  
`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CloudContent]  
"DisableSoftLanding"=dword:00000001`
3. Save the file with the .reg extension. Make sure that the Save as type field is set to **All files**.
4. Now, double-click on the file and click **Yes** at the prompt.

 That’s it! Tips and suggestions feature is now disabled on your computer.
