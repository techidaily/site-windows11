## Transforming Your Videos: Windows-Based MKV to MP4

 MKV is a multimedia container format that often stores multiple audio and subtitle tracks. However, since it is not as popular as other video file formats, such as MOV and MP4, playing an MKV file can become challenging on a Windows computer.

 If your device doesn’t support the MKV format, you can convert it to MP4\. It is a common multimedia format supported by almost all devices. Here we show you the best online and offline tools to convert MKV to MP4 in Windows.

## 1\. Convert MKV to MP4 Using XMedia Recode

 XMedia Recode is a capable media converter app for Windows. This little utility is free to use and supports all the major audio and video format conversions. Despite its capabilities, XMedia Recode has pretty basic hardware requirements to encode media files.

 Converting media files with the app is a straightforward process. Drag and drop to load the video, select the output format, click **Encode** and watch your MKV file convert into an MP4 file in an instant.

 For advanced users, XMedia Recode offers plenty of customization options for the audio and video formats. It also features subtitle support, a chapter editor, and pre-built filter support.

 To convert your MKV file to MP4 using XMedia Recode:

1. Go to the [Xmedia Recode page](https://www.xmedia-recode.de/en/download.php) and download the latest version of the app to your PC. Once downloaded, run the installer and complete the installation.
2. Launch **XMedia Recode.**
3. Drag and drop the media file onto the app interface to load it. Once loaded, select the media file to view the convert options.
4. In the **Format** tab, set **Profile** to **Custom** and **Format** as **MP4**.

5. Next, select **Video** and **Audio** in the **Output stream type** section.
6. Next, click **Browse** and select the output destination to save the video after conversion. For advanced customization features, explore the **Video, Audio, Subtitle, Filters/Preview**, and **Chapter Editor** tabs.

8. Next, open the **Queue** tab and select the convert job.
9. Click **Encode** in the toolbar to start the media file conversion.

 CloudConvert is easy to use, and the 25 free conversions per day make it an ideal tool for occasional conversions. However, if you have privacy concerns, consider using an offline converter to keep your videos in your local drive.

## 3\. Use OBS to Convert MKV to MP4

 A lesser-known OBS feature is its built-in MKV to MP4 converter. OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) is a free and open-source multi-platform tool primarily used for video streaming and game recording.

 As you can tell, OBS is not a conventional video converter. However, since it saves its game and screen recordings in the MKV format, the developers have included a Remux Recordings feature to facilitate quick MKV to MP4 conversions. Here’s how to use it to your advantage to convert your Matroska video files to MP4:

1. [Download and install OBS](https://obsproject.com/welcome) if you don’t have it already installed.
2. Once installed, launch OBS.
3. Click **File** and select **Remux Recordings**.  
![obs remux recording windows 1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/obs-remux-recording-windows-1.jpg)
4. In the **Remux Recordings** dialog, drag and drop your MKV file under **OBS Recordings**. It supports batch conversion, so feel free to add multiple files.
5. In the **Target File** section, you’ll see the default save location. By default, OBS sets the source folder as the destination folder. Click the **three-dots** (…) button to change the destination folder.  
![obs remux recording mkv to mp4](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/obs-remux-recording-mkv-to-mp4.jpg)
6. Click **Remux** to proceed. OBS will start converting the video. This may take some time to complete, depending on the video size.
7. Once done, click **OK**.

 While OBS can quickly convert MKV files to MP4 format, it doesn’t offer any customization options. If you need more customization options, XMedia Recode and HandBrake are your best options.

**Download**: [OBS](https://obsproject.com/welcome) (Free)

## 4\. Convert MKV to MP4 Using VLC Media Player

 VLC is a free, open-source multimedia player that supports almost all audio and video formats, including MKV. If you have VLC installed, you don’t need to convert and play the video.

 However, if you still need to convert your MKV video, you can do so using the Convert feature in VLC. It's one of the [best-hidden features of VLC media player](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-top-secret-features-free-vlc-media-player-si/).

1. Open the VLC media player app on your PC.
2. In the VLC main window, click on **Media** and select **Convert/Save**. Alternatively, press the **Ctrl + R** key to access **Convert/Save**.

![conver vlc media player destination profile](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/conver-vlc-media-player-destination-profile.jpg)
6. Next, click the **Browse** button and select the file destination. You may need to enter a new name for the file to prevent the VLC media player from overwriting your original MKV file if it is in the same destination.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

7. Once done, click **Start**.

 VLC media player timeline will show the conversion progress. Once it finishes, it will save your video to the destination folder.

 While VLC offers a handy video conversion feature, it can be painstakingly slow and even produce incomplete output with no audio or compromised video quality.

**Download**: [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/) (Free)

## 4\. HandBrake

 HandBrake is a free open-source video converter that supports almost all media formats. It is a multi-platform application available on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.

 HandBrake is one of the easiest video converters you can use. For casual conversions, all you have to do is drag and drop the video onto the app, and it will automatically apply the most commonly used container settings. You can then select the destination folder and start encoding to convert the video.

 If you need more advanced options, HandBrake has them in abundance. You can change the subtitles, add chapter markers, perform the batch scan, use video filters, and more.

 Here’s how to use HandBrake to convert MKV to MP4:

1. Go to the [HandBrake page](https://handbrake.fr/) and download the installer. Run the setup file and install the app.
2. Next, go to the [Microsoft DotNET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) and download **.NET 6.0 SDK x64**. Without this, HandBrake may not launch or work.
3. Next, open **HandBrake**.  
![HandBrake_convert mkv mp4](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/HandBrake_convert-mkv-mp4jpg.jpg)
4. Click on **File** to and then select the MKV file to convert. You can also drag and drop the file onto the app to open the file.
5. In the **Summary** tab, make sure the **Format** is set to **MP4**. Here, we are using the default MP4 container settings applied by the app.
6. Next, click the **Browse** button and choose a location to save your new file.
7. You can rename the file if you want to and click **Save**.
8. On HandBrake’s main window, click on **Start Encode**. HandBrake will start encoding the video, so wait till the process is complete. The processing time depends on your file size and system capability.

 The only downside to using HandBrake is having to download an additional set of .NET tools from Microsoft. Otherwise, it is an excellent open-source video converter utility that can cater to both casual and power users. You can also use it to [compress and reduce video file size without losing quality](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reduce-video-file-size-without-sacrificing-quality/).
