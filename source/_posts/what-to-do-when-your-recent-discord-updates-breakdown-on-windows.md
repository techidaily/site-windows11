## What to Do When Your Recent Discord Updates Breakdown on Windows

 Every time you launch Discord on your computer, the app searches for new updates. While that's a good thing, the process does not always go smoothly. At times, the Discord app may fail to update and become stuck.

 When a Discord update fails, you won't be able to use the app. If you're facing a similar problem, here are some potential fixes that'll make the Discord client accessible again.

## 1\. Rule Out Any Internet Issues

 One of the most common causes for a failed Discord update is a sluggish or inconsistent internet connection. Hence, before trying any advanced troubleshooting tips, you should rule out any issues with your internet connection.

 Test your internet connection by loading a few websites or visiting one of the[best websites for testing your internet speed](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/) . Additionally, if you’re using a VPN connection, temporarily disable it to see if that fixes the issue.

## 2\. Give Discord a Fresh Start

 When the Discord app fails to start correctly, it may become stuck on the "Checking for updates" message. If the issue is just a one-off glitch, then restarting the app should help you resolve it.

To force-stop the Discord app:

1. Press**Win + X** to open the Power User menu.
2. Select**Task Manager** from the list.
3. Right-click the**Discord** process and select**End task** from the resulting menu.
4. Restart the Discord app and see if it can finish the updates.

## 3\. Check Discord Server Status

 You may not be the only one experiencing problems with Discord updates. There's a good chance the issue isn't on your end, but on Discord's. You can[check Discord’s service status](https://discordstatus.com/) to see if others are facing similar issues.

 If there is a problem with the Discord servers, you have no option but to wait until the developers resolve it. Hopefully, it shouldn’t take too long. Following that, you should be able to update the Discord app on Windows.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Run Discord as an Administrator

 Another reason why Discord may not work or display the Update Failed error is a lack of certain permissions. To remedy this, you can try running Discord as an administrator. Simply right-click on the**Discord app icon** and select**Run as administrator** .

![Run Discord as Administrator](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Run-Discord-as-Administrator.jpg)

 If this helps Discord finish updates, you can configure the app to always run as an administrator. If you need help, refer to our guide on[how to always run apps as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/always-run-apps-administrator-windows/) and follow the steps outlined there.

## 5\. Allow Discord Through Windows Firewall

 Windows Defender Firewall can also prevent Discord from accessing the internet. If that's the case, you'll need to whitelist Discord in Windows Firewall to fix the problem. Here’s how:

1. Press**Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type**control panel** and select the first result that appears.
3. In the Control Panel window, use the drop-down menu in the top right corner to change the view type to**Large icons** .
4. Click on**Windows Defender Firewall** .
5. Select **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** from the left pane.
6. Click the**Change settings** button.
7. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
8. Locate**Discord** on the list and mark the checkboxes that read**Private** and**Public** .
9. Click**OK** to save the changes.

## 6\. Disable Your Antivirus Program

 If you have a third-party antivirus program installed on your computer, try disabling it temporarily. This will help you verify if your antivirus program is conflicting with the Discord app.

 After disabling your antivirus program, try to update Discord again. If this works, you'll need to whitelist Discord in your antivirus settings. Alternatively, you can switch to a different antivirus program altogether. There are plenty of[free and paid antivirus apps available for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-antivirus-apps/) .

## 7\. Adjust the Date and Time Settings

 Discord may have trouble connecting to its server[if your PC is set to an incorrect date or time](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-reasons-windows-computer-loses-time-date/) . You can avoid such problems by configuring Windows to use network-provided time. Here’s how.

1. Press**Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. Select**Time & language** from the left pane.
3. Click on**Date & time** .
4. Enable the toggles next to**Set time automatically** and**Set time zone automatically** .  
![Set Date & Time Automatically on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Set-Date--Time-Automatically-on-Windows.jpg)

Restart the Discord app after this and allow it to finish updates.

## 8\. Rename the Discord Update Executable File

 Problems with the Discord update file (update.exe) file on your PC can also cause such anomalies. This usually happens when the Discord update file becomes corrupted.

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
2. Type**%localappdata%** in the box and press**Enter** .
3. In the File Explorer window that opens, double-click the**Discord** folder.
4. Change the name of the**Update.exe** file to something else, such as**OldUpdate.exe** .

To uninstall Discord from your PC:

1. Open the**Start menu** and click the**gear-shaped icon** to launch the Settings app.
2. Use the left pane to navigate to the**Apps** tab.
