## What Type of Ads Will You See in the Start Menu

 Once you install the[KB5036980 update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/april-23-2024-kb5036980-os-builds-22621-3527-and-22631-3527-preview-5a0d6c49-e42e-4eb4-8541-33a7139281ed) on your Windows 11 PC, you can expect to see ads in the "Recommended" section of the Start menu. These won't be typical website ads; instead, they'll be Microsoft Store app recommendations. Clicking on an app suggestion will open its page in the Microsoft Store app, allowing you to read its description or download it.

 The good news is that Start menu ads will only show one or two app suggestions at a time. So, these ads won't clutter the "Recommended" section and are easy to ignore if you're not interested.

However, it's worth noting that it won't stop Microsoft from displaying ads in other places, such as the Settings app, lock screen, and File Explorer.
