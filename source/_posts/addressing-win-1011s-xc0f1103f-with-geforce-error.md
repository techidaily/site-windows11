## Addressing Win 10/11'S XC0F1103F with GeForce Error

 Some GeForce Now users have reported that their app no longer works because of error 0xc0f1103f. Those players see that error code when they start the GeForce Now app or games with it. Error 0xc0f1103f has a message that says, “Your system does not meet the minimum requirements for streaming.”

 That issue occurs on PCs that do meet the minimum streaming system requirements. Is the same error stopping you from playing GeForce Now titles? If so, this is how you can fix error 0xc0f1103f in Windows 10 and 11.

## Double-Check That Your PC Matches GeForce Now's System Requirements

 If you’re a first-time GeForce Now user, double-check your PC meets the streaming service’s system requirements before troubleshooting. Open the [GeForce Now system requirement page](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce-now/system-reqs/) for Windows PCs to check hardware requirements.

![GeForce Now system requirements](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/geforce-now-system-requirements.jpg)

 You can check how your PC’s specs match up by [opening the System Information app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-system-information/) . The system summary shows most of the essential hardware specs for GeForce Now streaming. You can view GPU details by clicking**Components** \>**Display** in the System Information app.

 You’ll need to upgrade your PC if it doesn’t match a system requirement. Desktop users can add new graphics adapters or even processors to their PCs if required. If your PC does indeed match all the GeForce Now requirements, proceed with the troubleshooting below.

## 1\. Double-Check if GeForce Now’s Servers Are Operational

 This error can occur because the GeForce Now server is down. For example, the server could be down for maintenance. You can check the service status for various regions on the [GeForce Now service status](https://status.geforcenow.com/) page. If a server for your region is down, wait until the service is operational again before opening the GeForce Now app again.

## 2\. Run GeForce Now With Administrator Rights

 Running GeForce Now with admin rights is a simple potential solution to try that’s worth a try. If you have a desktop shortcut for the software, right-click and select the**Run as administrator** option. Or you can enter**GeForce Now** in the Windows search box and right-click the app in the results to select**Run as administrator** .

![The Run as administrator option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/run-as-adminstrator-option.jpg)

 If that works, it’s best to set GeForce Now to always run with elevated rights. You can do that by opening the properties window for the GeForce Now EXE (Application) and selecting the**Run as administrator** checkbox. Check out our guide about [always running apps as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/always-run-apps-administrator-windows/) for further details.

## 3\. Select a Power Saving GPU for the GeForce Now App

 This resolution applies to users with PCs that have two GPUs (graphics processing units). Selecting a power-saving integrated GPU for the GeForce Now app is a widely confirmed fix for error 0xc0f1103f. This is how you can select an integrated GPU for the GeForce Now app in Windows:

1. First, activate the search utility with the**Win+ S** key combination.
2. Type**graphics settings** in the search box.
3. Click**Graphics settings** to open the options in Settings.
4. Then click**Browse** to bring up an Open window.
5. Select the GeForceNow app at this path:  
`C:\Users\[user folder]\AppData\Local\NVIDIA Corporation\GeForceNOW\CEF\GeForceNow.exe`
6. Click the**Add** button.
7. Select the added**GeForce Now** app and click its**Options** button.
8. Then select the**Power saving** (integrated GPU) option.

9. Click**Save** to apply the selected option.

## 4\. Update Your Graphics Card’s Driver

 Other users have said updating graphics drivers resolved the issue for them. You can update your PC’s graphics driver with third-party driver update software or download it from the NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel manufacturer site. Check out our guide for [updating graphics drivers on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-graphics-drivers-in-windows-10/) for further details about applying this potential error 0xc0f1103f solution.

## 5\. Restart All NVIDIA-Related Services

 This GeForceNow error can occur because certain NVIDIA certain services are not running or need restarting. You can fix that by going through and restarting (or starting) all NVIDIA services as follows:

1. Bring up Windows Search (see [how to find Windows Search](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-search-use-guide/) if you need help).
2. Input**Services** , then click the**Services** app the search tool finds.
3. Then scroll to NVIDIA-related services.

## 6\. Turn Off Any Active Proxy Servers

 Do you have a proxy server on your PC? If so, that could be causing the 0xc0f1103f error by generating a server issue. So, try disabling your proxy server on Windows via Settings or the Control Panel. Our article about [disabling your proxy server on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-proxy/) includes instructions for how to do so.

 Weaker VPN (Virtual Private Network) connections can also cause this game streaming issue to arise. If you utilize a VPN connection, disable it via the Windows Settings app like this:

1. Launch Settings by clicking the Start menu button or pinned shortcut for opening that app.
2. Then select the**Network & Internet** tab or category.
3. Click the**VPN** navigation option or tab.

5. Then select the**Disconnect** option for the VPN.
6. Open GeForce Now and try playing some games with the VPN disconnected.

3. Select**Uninstall** on the window that opens.
4. Restart Windows 11 or 10 after uninstalling GeForce Now.
5. Open the [GeForce Now](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/download/) [download page](http://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/download/) .
