 If you've never spent time using Microsoft Excel, it can feel a bit overwhelming at first. We'll teach you the basic tasks you need to know to use this popular spreadsheet application.

 From entering data and formatting numbers to adding cell borders and shading, knowing these essentials will ease the stress of learning to use Excel.

##  Entering Data in Excel

 First, you can click the cell and type your data into it. Second, you can click the cell and type the data into the Formula Bar which is at the top of the sheet.

![Data entered in a cell and the Formula Bar](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/EnterData-ExcelBeginnersBasics.png) 

 You can also copy data from another location and [paste it in your sheet](https://android-location.techidaily.com/9-best-free-android-monitoring-apps-to-monitor-phone-remotely-for-your-vivo-y100a-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/). Once you copy it, select the cell in your sheet and paste it by doing one of the following:

* Use the [keyboard shortcut](https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-high-definition-ready-enabling-av1-on-youtube/) **Ctrl+V** on Windows or **Command+V** on Mac.

##  Adding and Removing Columns and Rows

 You may discover that you need an additional [column or row](https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-frolicsome-media-repository-for-2024/) within your data set. Or, you might decide to remove a column or row you no longer need.

Related: [How to Add and Remove Columns and Rows in Microsoft Excel](https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-frolicsome-media-repository-for-2024/) 

###  Add a Column or Row

 You can insert a column or row a couple of different ways.

* Right-click a column or row and choose "Insert" from the shortcut menu.
* Select a column or row and go to the Home tab. Open the Insert drop-down box in the Cells section and pick "Insert Sheet Rows" or "Insert Sheet Columns."

 Both of the above actions insert a column to the left of the selected column or a row above the selected row.

###  Remove a Column or Row

 To remove a column or row, you can use similar actions. To select a column, click the column header which is the letter at the top. To select a row, click the row header which is the number on the left.

* Right-click the column or row and choose "Delete" from the shortcut menu.
* Select the column or row and go to the Home tab. Open the Delete drop-down box in the Cells section and pick "Delete Sheet Rows" or "Delete Sheet Columns."

##  Formatting Numbers

 When you [enter numbers in Excel](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-tracking-apps-to-track-xiaomi-redmi-12-5g-without-them-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), you can format them as ordinary numbers, currencies, decimals, percentages, dates, times, and fractions.

 Select a cell, go to the Home tab, and use the drop-down box in the Number section of the ribbon to pick the format. As you review the list of options, you'll see examples of how the data will appear.

##  Formatting Fonts and Cells

 Along with formatting the data within a cell, you can format the cell itself. You may want to use a specific font style, [apply a cell border](https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-3-effective-ways-to-unlock-icloud-account-without-password-on-apple-iphone-14-by-drfone-ios/), or add shading to a cell.

##  Performing Quick Calculations

 When you work with numbers in your sheet, it's common to perform calculations. Rather than delve into creating formulas in Excel, which is a bit more advanced, you can quickly add, average, or get the minimum or maximum number in a data set.

Related: [12 Basic Excel Functions Everybody Should Know](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-recorder-for-discord-enthusiasts/) 

 Go to the cell where you want to add the calculation. As an example, we'll [sum the cells](https://techtrends.techidaily.com/your-guide-to-securing-great-deals-on-apple-watch-models-this-month/) B2 through B6, so we pick cell B7.

![Cell B7 highlighted on a sheet](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CellB7-ExcelBeginnersBasics.png)

 Head to the Home tab and select the Sum drop-down box in the Editing section of the ribbon. You'll see the basic calculations you can perform. For our example, we select "Sum."

 You'll then see Excel highlight the cells it believes you want to calculate. It also shows you [the function](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-recorder-for-discord-enthusiasts/) and formula it'll use. Simply press Enter or Return to accept the suggestion and get the result.
