## Correcting Windows 11 Upgrade Problem - Code 0X800f0922

 It's recommended to regularly update Windows if you want to keep your system bugs-free and enjoy new features by Microsoft. While most updates install without any issue, some of them will throw an error during installation.

 The Windows Update error 0x800f0922 is one of the many update errors you might encounter while updating Windows 11\. Fortunately, it's a cakewalk to get rid of this error code. Check out the following fixes for the Windows 11 update error 0x800f0922.

## What Is Windows 11 Update Error 0x800f0922?

 Windows 11 updates are a contentious problem. Most users love its automation; others abhor how overbearing and demanding they can be. Whatever you prefer, there is always room for issues—namely, Windows 11 update error 0x800f0922.

 This error appears when users try to download the 2022-04 Cumulative update for Windows 11\. For most users, this error occurs the next moment after initiating the update. For others, it appears after 98% of the update has been downloaded.

 The error mainly appears when important Windows update services are not running in the background, or your computer doesn't have enough space to install the update. Also, corruption in the SoftwareDistribution folder can be a prime reason behind the error.

## 1\. Restart Your Device

 Whenever you face any Windows issues, including the update error 0x800f0922, your first port of call should be to restart the computer. Restarting the computer will reset all the memory caches and processes, which might be the reason behind the error.

## 2\. Use the Windows Update Troubleshooter

[Windows 11 features lots of integrated troubleshooters](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-troubleshooters/) which come in handy in different scenarios. To get rid of update errors, you can use the Windows Update troubleshooter.

 The troubleshooter will clear the Windows Update-related temporary files and repair the corrupt Windows Update components. Here's how to run the Windows Update troubleshooter on Windows 11:

1. Open the**Settings menu** by pressing the**Win + I** hotkeys and choose the**Troubleshoot** option.
2. Select**Other troubleshooters.**
3. Click the**Run** button next to**Windows Update.**  
![Run Troubleshooter in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/run-troubleshooter.jpg)

 The troubleshooter window will appear, and start scanning your computer for available issues. After the scan is complete, the troubleshooter will show the changes made to your computer or ask your permission to apply the fix. Grant it, and check if it resolves your issue.

## 3\. Clean Up Your Disk Drive

 Your computer must have enough space to download and install the Windows updates. If this isn't the case, you will likely face different issues, including the update error 0x800f0922.

 The solution, in this case, is to [free up disk space in your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-tips-free-disk-space-windows-10/) . One way to do that is by cleaning the drive containing the Windows 11 OS, which is C: drive for most users.

 To clean the drive, you can use the Disk Cleanup tool, which removes redundant files to create more space. Here's how to use it:

1. In the Start menu, type**Disk Cleanup** and press Enter.
2. Click the drop-down icon, select the drive containing Windows 11 OS, and then click**OK.**
3. Click the**Clean up system files** button.  
![Clean up system files option in Disk Cleanup](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/clean-up-system-files.jpg)
4. Under the**Files to delete** section, select the files you want to delete and click**OK.**  
![OK button in the Disk Cleanup](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ok-button.jpg)
5. Click the**Delete Files** option in the prompt that crops up.

 That's it. You have gained some space in the OS drive. If you want to create more space, you can remove unnecessary folders from the OS drive.

 For instance, you can [delete old Windows update files](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/delete-old-windows-update-files/) like the Windows.old folder, which contains data of the OS version previously installed on your computer. This folder is automatically created whenever you upgrade from Windows 10 to 11.

 There's no harm in deleting this folder, but make sure you only do it when you have no plans to return to Windows 10.

## 4\. Reset the Windows Update Components

 The update errors often result due to corruption in the Windows Update components. To detect and remove the corruption, you will have to reset the Windows Update components. Here's how:

1. In the Start menu, type**Command Prompt** and choose**Run as administrator** from the right pane.
2. In the console, type these four separate commands and press Enter after each:  
`net stop bits  
net stop wuauserv  
net stop appidsvc  
net stop cryptsvc`
3. Type the following command and press Enter to rename the SoftwareDistribution folder:  
`Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old`
4. Then, execute this command to rename the catroot2 folder:  
`Ren %systemroot%\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old`
5. Now, to restart the services, execute these four commands separately:  
`net start bits  
net start wuauserv  
net start appidsvc  
net start cryptsvc`

 After that, restart your computer and check whether you can update Windows 11 again.

## 5\. Change the Status of Important Services

 There are certain Windows services that must be running in the background if you want to update Windows. These services are**Windows event collector** ,**App readiness** ,**App optimization** , and**Geolocalization** .

 You'll have to change the Startup type of these services to Automatic to fix the problem. Here's how to do it:

1. In the Run dialog box, type**Services.msc** and click**OK.**
2. Search for and double-click on the**Windows Event Collector** service.
3. Click the drop-down icon next to the**Startup type** and choose**Automatic** from the list.  
![Automatic option in the Services window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/automatic-option.jpg)
4. Click the**Start** button under the**Service status** option.
5. Click**Apply** \>**OK** to save the changes.

Next, repeat the above steps for other mentioned services as well.

## 6\. Manually Download and Install Updates

 If updating Windows through the Settings app is throwing an error, you can download and install updates [using the Microsoft update catalog](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/microsoft-windows-update-catalog/) . You can do it by following the below instructions:

1. Open the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Home.aspx) on your browser.
2. In the search bar, type the**KB number** of the update you want to install. In this case, it's**KB5012643.**
3. Click**Search.**
4. In the result window, you'll get two options –**ARM64** and**x64.** Click the**Download** button next to the system type you're using.  
![Different download option in Update catalog](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/different-download-option.jpg)
5. A new window will appear, right-click on the download link, choose the**Save link as,** and select the folder where you want to download the update package.

 Next, open the location where you have downloaded the update package and double-click on it to begin the installation.
