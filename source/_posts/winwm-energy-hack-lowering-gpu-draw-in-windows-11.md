## WinWM Energy Hack: Lowering GPU Draw in Windows 11

 The Desktop Window Manager (DWM) is an essential Windows process that oversees the visual elements of your desktop interface. It manages tasks such as visual animations, transparency effects, thumbnails, and the taskbar.

 However, the DWM can occasionally consume significant GPU resources, affecting the overall system performance. If you find that the Desktop Window Manager consumes a lot of GPU resources, try the solutions below to troubleshoot the problem for good.

## What Causes the Desktop Windows Manager's High GPU Usage on Windows?

 Before getting into the solutions, it's crucial to understand the root causes behind this issue. While the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) may consume a significant amount of GPU resources for various reasons, the most common ones are listed below:

* Outdated or corrupted graphics card drivers often stand as the primary cause of excessive GPU consumption by the Desktop Window Manager.
* [Hardware acceleration](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-hardware-acceleration/) on third-party applications can increase the burden on your GPU, ultimately leading to the issue at hand.
* Your computer's HDR display settings could also be a reason behind the high GPU consumption by the Desktop Window Manager.

 Now that you know the potential culprits, let's check out the methods to rectify them.

## 1\. Update Your Graphics Driver

 We cannot stress enough the importance of regularly updating your graphics driver. An updated graphics driver ensures your system remains immune to graphics-related issues and provides you access to the latest features from your GPU manufacturer.
