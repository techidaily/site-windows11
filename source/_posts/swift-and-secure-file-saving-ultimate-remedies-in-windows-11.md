 Here's how to do it:

2. Click the **Sign out** option. Then, choose **Sign out** again from the prompt that appears.

 To find the problematic object, copy all inserted objects and paste them into a new slide. The object that is [failing to copy and paste](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-copy-paste-not-working/) into the new slide is the culprit.

 Remove that object from your presentation, and then try to save the file. If you still get the error, continue with the guide.
