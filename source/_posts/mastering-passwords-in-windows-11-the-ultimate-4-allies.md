## Mastering Passwords in Windows 11: The Ultimate 4 Allies

 A dedicated password manager for Windows can do a whole lot more than the ones in your web browser. Apart from managing and securely storing passwords, it can store critical notes and documents, bank and other financial details, identification details, generate strong passwords, sync your password across devices, and monitor for stolen and leaked passwords online.

 Fortunately, password managers are usually cross-platform, so, you don't need to juggle between multiple password managers to store your password on multiple devices. Here we look at the best password managers for Windows 11 that offer both great security and good value for money.

## 1\. Bitwarden

 Bitwarden is one of the best overall, and thanks to its core features, it is probably the best free password manager for Windows. It is a cross-platform, open-source utility available on Windows, MacOS, web browsers, and mobile platforms.

 The standard features of Bitwarden are identical to other password managers. It helps you save, generate and manage your logins safely. The data is secured by [zero-knowledge end-to-end AES-256-bit encryption](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-aes-256-encryption-how-does-it-work/). In addition, it also uses salted hashing and PBKDF2 as the underlying pseudorandom function.

 It also supports multi-factor authentication, password sharing, and unlimited password storage for multiple users. On compatible devices, you can unlock the Bitwarden vault through biometric authentication. If you would rather have full control over the data, you can also self-host Bitwarden on your own server.

 The desktop application is nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. You can view, add, and trash saved data. Furthermore, you can also create folders to better organize and keep your data mess-free.

 It features an impressive import and export feature as well. You can import passwords from over 50 password managers and export the existing data vault in JSON, JSON (encrypted), and CSV file formats.

 Some advanced features are behind the paywall. For example, the premium plan includes advanced two-factory authentication, emergency access, security reports, weak password monitoring, and the Bitwarden authenticator.

**Download**: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) (Free, subscription available at $10/yr)

## 2\. Keeper

![keeyper password manager windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/keeyper-password-manager-windows-1.jpg)

 Keeper has had a design overhaul, making this trusted password manager an even more attractive proposition. It is a premium utility for desktop and web users and offers a month of free unlimited trial, except for the security add-ons. Mobile users can use the free version with some limitations.

 Keeper offers advanced encrypted and a zero-knowledge model to keep your data secure and private. You can share the credentials across the team or keep it in your personal vault. While it is a cross-platform service, Keeper’s desktop app may be the best across all password managers. It’s clean, easy to use, and offers plenty of features.

 In Keeper, you can create new credentials records or import a CSV file from the popular password managers, including Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass. Once imported, you can modify the records to add new details and generate a stronger password. Open the Security Audit tab to view your existing password strength and how often you reuse and repeat your passwords.

 The premium plan offers unlimited password storage, supports unlimited devices and sync, secure password sharing, biometric-based login, emergency access, and customer support.

 Keeper’s Secure add-ons are optional but premium features. It includes secure file storage to save your files and a BreachWatch tool that [monitors the dark web for stolen passwords](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-dark-web-monitoring-and-do-you-need-it/). It also has Keeper Chat, a private hyper-secure messaging platform.

 That said, having to pay additionally for some add-ons may turn some people off of this option.

**Download**: [Keeper](https://www.keepersecurity.com/) ($34.99/yr)

## 3\. 1Password

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 1Password is another popular password management service with robust vault organization features and an extra layer of security. When you create an account, it will automatically generate a secret key on top of a strong master password set by the user. You’ll need the secret key and the master password to log in to your 1Password account on the web and devices.

 1Password features all the core features of a password manager, including the ability to save, autofill, edit, and delete records. It also supports two-factor authentication setups for supported account types.

 In addition, you can share your credentials with your contacts or anyone with a link with a predefined expiration time and view limit set. And you can [store your crypto credentials with 1Password](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-store-crypto-credentials-1password/), too.

 Watchtower is another highlighted feature in the service. It monitors your credentials for security strength, shows reused and weak passwords, and supports two-factor authentication. Interestingly, these insights seem to differ greatly from one password manager to another.

 The desktop application is intuitive and offers decent organizing options via tags and categories. However, the "Import" feature seems to be tricky. Unless you are importing from LastPass or 1Password’s unencrypted export file, you can only import credentials from its web interface. Even then, the imported records look cluttered, and you may need to re-edit and re-organize them to make sense of them.

 1Password is a premium utility and comes with a free two weeks trial. After the trial period ends, you can choose from one of its premium offerings starting at $2.99 a month, which offers unlimited items, multiple device access, and 1GB of secure storage.

**Download**: [1Password](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2028470/https://1password.com/) (Free trial, then subscription at $2.99/m)

## 4\. Dashlane

 Dashlane is an excellent premium password manager available on the web, browsers, and mobile devices. Unfortunately, the company has discontinued its desktop application, which is not ideal if you want to access your credentials via a desktop app.

 If a desktop app is not a must, Dashlane has plenty to offer. On the security front, it features a zero-knowledge architecture combined with end-to-end AES-256 encryption and two-factor authentication to secure your credentials.

 Dashlane offers a web-first experience on desktops. So, you are limited to the browser extension and the web app to manage and sync your credentials across devices. The extension is intuitive, with frequently used features like Vault, Autofill, and password generator available with a click.

 The free tier plan offers basic password management features, including unlimited passwords and passkey storage, secure sharing, a password generator and autofill, 1GB encrypted document storage, password history, and live chat support.

 Paid plans for personal use start at $2.75 per month and gives you access to premium features. This includes access on unlimited devices and dark web monitoring to get notified of your leaked or stolen credentials.

 If you want more, look at Dashlane’s Premium plan, which has VPN access. However, an important point to note is that It’s not a standalone VPN app but an integrated version of Hotspot Shield VPN, which is not exactly known for its privacy championing.
