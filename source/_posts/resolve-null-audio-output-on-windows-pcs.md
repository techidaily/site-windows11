![enable audio device paly sound windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/enable-audio-device-paly-sound-windows.jpg)

 Check if you have accidentally disabled your audio device. While the audio troubleshooter should be able to detect and recommend the same, you can also enable the audio device manually.

 To check and enable your audio output device:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the **Run** dialog.
2. Type **mmsys.cpl** and click **OK** to open the **Sound** dialog.
3. In the **Playback** tab, locate your audio output device. If no device is listed, right-click within the **Playback** section and select **Show disabled devices.**

## 5\. Check if the Audio Services are Running

 The Windows Audio Endpoint Service and Windows Audio Service are the two essential services for the audio to work on your PC. If these services are not running, your audio device may not function properly.

 So, ensure the two services are running and set to startup automatically. Follow these steps to do the same:

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**.
2. Type **services.msc** and click **OK** to open the **Services** snap-in.

8. Next, repeat the steps for the **Windows Audio service.**
9. Once done, close the Services snap-in.

## 6\. Uninstall or Disable Any Third-Party Driver Updater Tools

 Third-party driver update utilities allow you to scan and update all the drivers for your computer from one place. While a handy tool, this may conflict with your audio component and Windows’s ability to detect the device.

 To fix the problem, disable or remove any driver update utility such as Avast Driver Updater installed on your PC. Then run the audio troubleshooter again to see if that helps resolve the issue. Sometimes, you may need to remove the updater app to disable it completely.

## 7\. Repair the Windows Image With DISM

![DISM scan health restore health command prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/dism-scan-health-restore-health-command-prompt.jpg)
