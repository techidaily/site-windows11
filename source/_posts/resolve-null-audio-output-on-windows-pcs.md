## 5\. Check if the Audio Services are Running

 So, ensure the two services are running and set to startup automatically. Follow these steps to do the same:

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**.
2. Type **services.msc** and click **OK** to open the **Services** snap-in.

## 6\. Uninstall or Disable Any Third-Party Driver Updater Tools

 Third-party driver update utilities allow you to scan and update all the drivers for your computer from one place. While a handy tool, this may conflict with your audio component and Windows’s ability to detect the device.

 To fix the problem, disable or remove any driver update utility such as Avast Driver Updater installed on your PC. Then run the audio troubleshooter again to see if that helps resolve the issue. Sometimes, you may need to remove the updater app to disable it completely.
