## Create Efficiency in Windows: Unique Snapping Layouts with PowerToys

 With the Snap Layouts feature in Windows, you can snap your windows into different positions and organize your computer screen to your liking. As useful as this feature is, it does not give you the option to edit pre-defined layouts or customize them in any way.

 Fortunately, you don’t have to settle for the default snap layout options. With PowerToys, you can create custom snap layouts for your Windows 10 or 11 computer and multitask with ease. Let’s see how.

## How to Create Custom Snap Layouts in PowerToys

 PowerToys' FancyZones feature lets you arrange your windows into custom layouts. Here's how you can use its layout editor to create and save custom snap layouts.

1. [Download and install PowerToys](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-powertoys/XP89DCGQ3K6VLD) from Microsoft Store.
2. Once installed, open the**PowerToys** app [using the search menu](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-search-use-guide/) .
3. Select the**FancyZones** tab from the left sidebar.
4. Turn on the toggle next to**Enable FancyZones** .

 You can repeat the above steps to create as many custom layouts as you want.

To use your custom snap layout created with PowerToys, you'll need to hold the**Shift key** and then drag the window to one of your zones.

 Similarly, in the**Window behavior** section, you can use the checkboxes to specify how windows should behave when you use FancyZones.
