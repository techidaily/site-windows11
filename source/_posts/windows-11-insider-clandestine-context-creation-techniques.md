## Windows 11 Insider: Clandestine Context Creation Techniques

 File Explorer has a Hidden items option you can select to reveal hidden files and folders. Those are mainly important system files and folders hidden for good reason. However, you can also select to hide user files as well.

 Explorer’s **View** menu and tab (in Windows 10) include the **Hidden items** option. However, you can make that option a little more accessible by adding it to the context menu. Then you can toggle hidden files on/off from the right-click menu. This is how you can add a **Hidden items** option to the context menu in Windows 10 and 11\.

## How to Add a Hidden Items Option to the Context Menu With a Registry Script

 To add any new option to a Windows context menu, we must modify the registry. Adding a **Hidden items** option to the context menu involves a slightly more complicated registry tweak. So, it’s best to add such an option to the right-click menu with a more automated registry script method like this:

1. Open this [Winaero download page](https://winaero.com/download-toggle-hidden-items-context-menu-in-windows-10-regsitry-tweak/) in web-browsing software.
2. Then select **Click here to download the file** option for the registry script archive.
3. Press both the **Windows** logo and **E** keyboard keys at the same time to [access File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/).
4. Navigate to whatever folder the **hidden\_files\_context\_menu** ZIP downloaded in.
5. Unzip (extract) the **hidden\_files\_context\_menu** ZIP file. We have a guide that includes instructions for [unzipping ZIP archives in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/).  
![The Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folder tool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/extraction-utility.jpg)

1. Open the extracted hidden\_files\_context\_menu folder.
2. Double-click the **Add hidden files** **context menu** command registry script file.

3. Select **Yes** if a User Account Control prompt pops up.
4. Click **Yes** within the Registry Editor dialog box that asks if you’re sure about continuing.

5. Select **OK** on the second dialog box that appears.

 Now bring up the root C: directory in File Explorer to try out the new **Hidden items** context menu option. Right-click anywhere inside that folder to select **Show more options** on Windows 11’s context menu and **Hidden items**. Selecting that option will reveal a few hidden folders in the root directory if that setting isn’t enabled already. Click the same option again to hide the folder and files again.

 The **hidden\_files\_context\_menu** ZIP archive also includes another registry script for removing the context menu. So, you don’t need to manually edit the registry to remove the **Hidden items** context menu. Running the **Undo hidden files in context menu** script will do the job for you.

## How to Add a Hidden Items Option to the Context Menu With Right-Click Extender

 Or you can add options for toggling file visibility to the context menu with Right-Click Extender. Right-Click Extender is a freely available app that includes numerous customization settings for adding new options to the context menus in Windows 11/10\. This is how to add context menu options for showing/hiding hidden files and folders with Right-Click Extender:

1. Go to this [Right-Click Extender](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/System-Tweak/Right-Click-Extender.shtml) Softpedia download page.
2. Press the **Download** button there to view location options.
3. Click on **Secure Download (US)**, which is the best option for users in North America.
4. Open the folder where your browser downloads the Right-Click Extender ZIP file to within File Explorer.
5. Unzip the Right-Click Extender ZIP archive.
6. Open Right-Click Extender’s extracted directory and double-click on the Right-Click Extender v2 subfolder.
7. Double-click the **Right-Click Extender** file to open that app’s window.
8. Click the **File**/**Folder** tab in Right-Click Extender.  
![toggle-items-checkbox](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/toggle-items-checkbox.jpg)
9. Select the **Toggle File**/**Folder Visibility** option along with its Icon checkbox.
10. Click on the **Apply** button.

 Now bring up the classic context menu within a folder in File Explorer by pressing **Shift** \+ **F10**. There you’ll see a new **Toggle File Visibility** submenu. Move your cursor over the **Toggle File Visibility** submenu to select a **Show Hidden Files** option. You can conceal the items again by selecting the opposite **Hide Hidden Files** option.

## Toggle Hidden Items On and Off From File Explorer’s Context Menu

 So, now you can select to show or hide files and folders from your context menu. If you select to show hidden items, you can see and access more folders and files in Windows. A context menu option for enabling/disabling hidden items can be especially useful for users who select to hide things with the attribute settings for files and folders.

 Explorer’s **View** menu and tab (in Windows 10) include the **Hidden items** option. However, you can make that option a little more accessible by adding it to the context menu. Then you can toggle hidden files on/off from the right-click menu. This is how you can add a **Hidden items** option to the context menu in Windows 10 and 11\.
