## Revolutionizing Mouse Interactions on Windows via ClickLock Techniques

 Enabling Mouse ClickLock when working on a desktop or laptop can make things easier and speedier. Once set, the ClickLock locks mouse clicks and lets you highlight or drag text without holding the mouse button down all the time.

 ClickLock can help you use the mouse easily, especially if you are suffering from a hand ailment that hinders movement. Or maybe you find it more convenient to not hold down the mouse button. Either way, here's how to turn it on.

1. Type**Mouse Settings** in**Windows Search** and click on**Mouse Settings** under**Best match** .
2. **Mouse** settings will open under**Bluetooth and devices** settings. Scroll down to the**Related settings** section and click on**Additional mouse settings** .

## How to Set the ClickLock Time in Mouse Settings

## How to Set the ClickLock Time via Registry Editor
