## Understanding & Resolving Missing HDD Issue in Windows 11 OS

 Are you unable to use your computer because of the "Hard drive not installed" issue? If so, don't worry, you're not alone.

 Windows PCs can fail to boot and display the "Hard drive not installed" message for a variety of reasons, including hardware failure, a damaged CMOS battery, or an incorrect boot priority order.

 Fortunately, you can quickly fix this problem and continue using your device using the solutions below.

## 1\. Check the Hard Drive for Any Loose Connections or Physical Damage

 The first course of action whenever you encounter the "Hard drive not installed" issue is to ensure that the hard drive is properly connected to your computer. To do this, shut down your computer (check out [different ways to shut down a Windows PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-how-to-shut-down/)) and unplug it from the power outlet.

 Next, open your computer's back case and ensure that all the cables connecting the hard drive to the motherboard and the power supply are securely connected. You can also reseat the cables by disconnecting them from the hard drive and the power supply and then reconnecting them after a few seconds.

 After that, carefully inspect the hard drive for any physical damage. Check for cracks, dents, or any other signs of wear. Additionally, check for any indications of liquid damage or unusual noises emanating from the hard drive. If you detect any of these issues, unfortunately, the only option is to replace your hard drive.

## 2\. Perform a Hard PC Reset

## 3\. Change the Boot Priority Order

 You might face the "hard drive not installed" issue if your computer is trying to boot from a connected external device. To confirm this, unplug all external devices from your computer, including your USB mouse, keyboard, and external backup hard drive.

 Then, restart your computer and see if the problem persists. If it doesn't, then your computer was probably trying to boot from one of the external devices you unplugged.

 To configure your computer to boot correctly even when those external devices are connected, you must set your internal hard drive as the first boot device. Here's how to do it.

 The following steps are for Dell computers. The steps may vary depending on your computer manufacturer. Therefore, make sure to check your computer manufacturer's website to learn about the exact process of changing the boot priority.

1. Restart your computer and press the **BIOS key** (usually Delete, F2, or ESC) repeatedly as soon as you see the manufacturer's logo.
2. Click **Boot Sequence** in the left sidebar.
3. If **UEFI** is selected and then select **Legacy External Devices**. Or, if **Legacy External Devices** is selected and then select **UEFI**.

 Then, restart your computer and check for the issue.

## 4\. Change Your System Date and Time

 An [incorrect date and time](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-reasons-windows-computer-loses-time-date/) can impact how your computer boots up or prevent it from booting at all. So, make sure your computer is showing the current date and time. You can change the date and time by following the instructions below.

1. Open the BIOS menu and choose **Date /Time** from the left sidebar.  
![Date_and_Time option in BIOS menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/date_and_time.jpg)
2. Set the correct Date and Time. Then, click **Apply**.

 After that, restart your computer and check if the issue is resolved. If the problem is gone, but you need to set the date and time every time you boot your computer, it is likely that your computer's CMOS battery is failing. The only way to fix this is to [replace the CMOS battery](https://www.makeuseof.com/computer-battery-dead-how-fix-replace-cmos/).
