## Bridging Windows Prefixes with Microsoft Services

 If you have a genuine copy of Windows 10 or 11 (which you should have!) linking the product key to your Microsoft account is very important. Doing so can prevent headaches down the line when you need to use it again.

 In this article, we'll guide you through linking your Windows product key to your Microsoft account.

## What Are the Benefits of Linking a Microsoft Account to a Windows Product Key?

 Linking your Windows Product key to your Microsoft account may not bring immediate benefits to you, but in the long run, there are lots of advantages that you can't afford to overlook.

 One major benefit is that you can reactivate Windows quickly, thus eliminating the need for you to type your 25-character product key or contact Microsoft to verify the key. So, if you're planning to make significant hardware changes to your PC, make sure that you link the product key to your Microsoft account before making such modifications.

 Linking your key to your Microsoft account also helps you track your devices and licenses on the **Account** page in Windows Settings app. However, linking your Windows licenses to the Microsoft account will also mean that the software company will collect and share your data with some of its partners and advertisers.

 That said, you can control which types of data you want or don't want to share with the companies. In other words, a Microsoft account is not exactly a direct threat to your privacy if you know how to use it. If you're still worried, learn [how to make your data worthless to big tech companies](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-minimize-big-tech-data-collection/).

 Before jumping to the steps, check if your Windows product key is already linked to your Microsoft account. The process is simple and won't take much of your time.

1. Open the Settings app by pressing the **Win key** \+ **I** key on your keyboard.
2. Click **Activation**.
3. Expand the **Activation state** drop-down menu by clicking on it.

 If your Windows product is linked to your Microsoft account, clicking on the **Activation state** should show you a message that reads, "Windows is activated with a digital license." If you don't see that message, you need to link the product key to the Microsoft account.

 If you're running Windows 10, hit the Start menu, type Windows Activation, and check your activation status. You'll see the same message as above if yours is already linked to the Microsoft account.
