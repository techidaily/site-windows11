## Top Secret Tips for Accessing Win11's Credential Vault in Under a Minute

 Credential Manager in Windows 11 stores all the username and password combinations that you use for websites you visit in Edge browsers, apps, or networks. Microsoft introduced Credential Manager with Windows 10 and since then it stores and manages all credentials in one place. You can even back up and remove credential entries that are obsolete.

 The most obvious method to access the Credential Manager is using the Control Panel. But do you know that there are other methods to access this password management too? We will list out all the possible ways to open it quickly. Let’s begin.

3. The Credential Manager utility will launch on your system.

## 7\. Using a Desktop Shortcut

 A desktop shortcut can save much time in Credential Manager on the system. Since it is not an executable program but a DLL file, merely making a desktop shortcut won’t work. Instead, we will create a shortcut of the Credential Manager DLL file and configure it to open with Control Panel.

 Repeat the following steps to create a shortcut for Credential Manager:

1. Press**Win + D** to switch to Desktop.
2. Right-click on the Desktop and select the**New > Shortcut** option from the context menu.
3. In the Create Shortcut window, paste the following text in the Location box:**control.exe /name Microsoft.CredentialManager**  
![Open Credentials Manager Using a Desktop Shortcut](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/open-credentials-manager-using-a-desktop-shortcut.jpg)
4. Click on the**Next** button. Name the shortcut**Credential Manager** and click on the**Finish** button.
5. Now, double-click on the shortcut to open Credential Manager.

## 8\. Using the Settings App

 Microsoft hasn’t moved all Control Panel options to the Settings app. But it is possible to search and access Credential Manager inside the Settings app. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Right-click** on the Start button to open the Power User menu. Select the**Settings** option from the menu.
2. Navigate to the top-left corner and click on the**Find a setting** option.  
![Open Credentials Manager Using the Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/open-credentials-manager-using-the-settings-app.jpg)
3. Type**Credential Manager** and click on the first relevant search result for the utility.

## 9\. Using a PowerShell Command

 Like the Command Prompt, you can use PowerShell to open Credential Manager with a simple one-line command. Here’s how to do it:

1. Press**Win + S** to[open Windows Search](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-search-use-guide/) .
2. Type**PowerShell** and click on the**Run as administrator** option in the right pane.
3. Type the following command in the PowerShell window and press the**Enter** key:**start-process control.exe keymgr.dll**  
![Open Credentials Manager Using a PowerShell Command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/open-credentials-manager-using-a-powershell-command.jpg)
4. Credential Manager will open. Type the**exit** command in the PowerShell window and press the**Enter** key to close it.

## 10\. Using a Batch File

 A batch file is a more convenient method to open Credential Manager whenever you need it. You can place it on the desktop and run it with administrator privileges just like a shortcut. Repeat the following steps to create a batch file:

1. Press**Win + D** to switch to the Desktop. Right-click on the desktop and select the**New > Text Document** option.
2. Open the empty text document and paste the following code snippet:  
`@echo off powershell.exe control.exe keymgr.dll`
3. Press**Ctrl + Shift + S** to open the**Save as** window. Name the file “**CredMgr.bat** ” and click on the**Save** button.  
![Open Credentials Manager Using a Batch File](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/open-credentials-manager-using-a-batch-file.jpg)
4. Close the Notepad file. Navigate to the location where you saved the CredMgr.bat file.
5. Right-click on it and select the**Run as administrator** option.
6. The PowerShell window will launch and close automatically. Credential Manager will launch on your system.

## 11\. Using the Task Manager

 You can open Credentials Manager by running a new task in Task Manager. Here’s how to do it:

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run command box. Type**taskmgr** in the text input area and press the**Enter** key to open Task Manager.
2. In the Task Manager window, click on the**Run new task** button.
