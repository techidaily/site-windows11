2. Click on the**Installed Apps** option. Then click on the**Search for app** option and type Microsoft Store.

### 2\. Restart Your Computer

 If terminating the app doesn't do anything, do a system restart. It will clear all the apps from the memory, close all the background apps and services, and restart them. Do not use shutdown because Microsoft enables Fast start-up by default and that doesn't close system and kernel-level processes from the memory.

 After your computer restarts, launch Microsoft Store and try to install the Clipchamp app on your system.

### 3\. Set the Correct Time, Date, and Region

 Incorrect date and time and region settings can cause the Microsoft Store app to not load content or install apps properly. Here's how to update the date, time, and region on your system:

1. Press**Win + I** to launch the Settings app.
2. Click on the**Time & language** option from the left-hand side menu.
3. Click on the**Date & time** option and then click on the**Sync now** button.
