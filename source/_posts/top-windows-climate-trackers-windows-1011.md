## Top Windows Climate Trackers (Windows 10/11)

 Windows 11 has a built-in weather widget that shows the basic weather info, including temperature, forecast for the upcoming week, and precipitation.

 But a good weather app can do much more. It can give you hurricane or extreme weather alerts and air quality information so that you can plan your outings accordingly. Here are the best weather apps for Windows 10 and 11 to match your purpose and style.

## 1\. The Windows 11 Weather Widget

[Windows 11 features a Weather widget](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/weather-widgets-windows-7/) in the bottom left corner of the taskbar. Hover your mouse over or click the Widget icon to view all the widgets.

 The Weather widget displays weather information necessary to plan your day. It shows the temperature for the current region, the lowest and highest temperature for the day and the next few days, and cloud cover information.

 It fetches information from the MSN weather forecast web app. Click on any weather condition to view detailed information on the web app. That said, it is a rudimentary app for those who need to know the temperature for the day and if it will rain.

 To customize the widget, click the three-dots menu and select Customize. Here, you can change the location and switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. You can use Microsoft’s MSN Weather app for Windows if you need more.

## 5\. MyRadar

![Myradar Windows Weather App App Running on Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/myradar-windows-weather-app.jpg)

 MyRadar may not be as popular amongst Windows users, but it has over 50 million downloads on iOS and Android platforms. It is a weather forecast app that displays animated weather radar for your current location.

 You can select your region or view other parts of the map with scroll-to-zoom. With the region selected, click on the Forecast icon to view the temperature, Air Quality Index, and precipitation forecast at a glance.

 You can also view the hourly forecast for the day and up to 10 days of forecast predictions for temperature, precipitation, winds, and cloud cover. It also offers weather warnings and alerts in your area via push notifications.

 On the flip side, MyRadar is not available in all countries, which may also affect its accuracy. For example, it’ll be more likely to show an accurate weather forecast to someone living in Santa Fe than someone living in India. So, your mileage may vary depending on where you live.

**Download**: [MyRadar](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/myradar/9WZDNCRFHZN6) (Free, premium version available)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 SimpleWeather, as the name indicates, is a simple weather app to get the forecast for your current and other locations. The home screen shows the day's current, highest, and lowest temperature. As you scroll down, it’ll display the forecast for the next few days, hourly weather details, UV Index, and Air Quality Index.

 During setup, you can choose the location, weather forecast update frequency, and your preferred temperature measurement unit to set up the app. In the left pane, you can view severe weather alerts, the weather radar, and your favorite locations.

 SimpleWeather works well for the most part, except when it chooses to crash when you try to access the radar feature. It also fails to save your initial setup configuration and requires you to re-do it.
