 This error appears when users try to download the 2022-04 Cumulative update for Windows 11\. For most users, this error occurs the next moment after initiating the update. For others, it appears after 98% of the update has been downloaded.

 The error mainly appears when important Windows update services are not running in the background, or your computer doesn't have enough space to install the update. Also, corruption in the SoftwareDistribution folder can be a prime reason behind the error.

## 1\. Restart Your Device

 Whenever you face any Windows issues, including the update error 0x800f0922, your first port of call should be to restart the computer. Restarting the computer will reset all the memory caches and processes, which might be the reason behind the error.

## 2\. Use the Windows Update Troubleshooter

[Windows 11 features lots of integrated troubleshooters](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-troubleshooters/) which come in handy in different scenarios. To get rid of update errors, you can use the Windows Update troubleshooter.

 The troubleshooter will clear the Windows Update-related temporary files and repair the corrupt Windows Update components. Here's how to run the Windows Update troubleshooter on Windows 11:

1. Open the**Settings menu** by pressing the**Win + I** hotkeys and choose the**Troubleshoot** option.
2. Select**Other troubleshooters.**
3. Click the**Run** button next to**Windows Update.**  
![Run Troubleshooter in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/run-troubleshooter.jpg)

 The troubleshooter window will appear, and start scanning your computer for available issues. After the scan is complete, the troubleshooter will show the changes made to your computer or ask your permission to apply the fix. Grant it, and check if it resolves your issue.

## 3\. Clean Up Your Disk Drive

 Your computer must have enough space to download and install the Windows updates. If this isn't the case, you will likely face different issues, including the update error 0x800f0922.

 The solution, in this case, is to [free up disk space in your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-tips-free-disk-space-windows-10/) . One way to do that is by cleaning the drive containing the Windows 11 OS, which is C: drive for most users.

 To clean the drive, you can use the Disk Cleanup tool, which removes redundant files to create more space. Here's how to use it:

1. In the Start menu, type**Disk Cleanup** and press Enter.
2. Click the drop-down icon, select the drive containing Windows 11 OS, and then click**OK.**
3. Click the**Clean up system files** button.

4. Under the**Files to delete** section, select the files you want to delete and click**OK.**  
![OK button in the Disk Cleanup](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ok-button.jpg)
5. Click the**Delete Files** option in the prompt that crops up.

 There's no harm in deleting this folder, but make sure you only do it when you have no plans to return to Windows 10.
