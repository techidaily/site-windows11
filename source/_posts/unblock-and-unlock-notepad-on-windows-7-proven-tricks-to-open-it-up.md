## 5\. Run the SFC and DISM Scans

 Corrupted system files could also interfere with system processes and prevent Notepad from opening. The System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in utility that can help you repair system files on Windows. It basically scans your system for damaged system files and replaces them with their cached versions.

To run the SFC scan on Windows:

1. Click the magnifying icon on the taskbar to open the search menu.
2. Type**command prompt** in the box and select**Run as administrator** .
3. When the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears, select**Yes** to continue.
4. In the console, input the following command and press**Enter** :  
`sfc /scannow`

 Wait for the scan to complete and then enter the following command to run the DISM (or Deployment Image Servicing and Management) scan. It will try to detect and repair any issues with the system image.

`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 After the scan is complete, restart your PC and see if you can access Notepad.

## 6\. Perform a Clean Boot

 At times, third-party apps and background services can conflict with Windows processes and cause problems like the one discussed here. One way to verify this possibility is to boot your computer in a clean boot state, where it only runs with essential apps and services.

 If you perform a clean boot and Notepad opens normally, it means that the culprit causing the issue got disabled. If you'd like to learn more about the topic, check out our guide on[how to perform a clean boot on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-perform-clean-boot-windows-10/) and follow the steps listed there.

## 7\. Create Another User Account

 If some of the files in your user account have become corrupt, you may have difficulty performing simple tasks like opening an app. If that seems to be the case, your best option is to create and switch to a new user account.

To create a new user account on Windows:

1. Use one of the[many ways to open the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
2. Navigate to**Accounts > Other users** .
3. Click the**Add account** button.
4. In the Microsoft account window, click **I don't have this person's sign-in information** .  
![Microsoft Account Sign-In Window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/microsoft-account-sign-in-window.jpg)

 Follow the on-screen prompts to create a new user account. Make sure you give the new account administrative privileges so that you can[move your personal files and data to the new account](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-copy-files-between-user-accounts/) with ease.

 Once you sign in with your newly created account, Notepad should open without problems.

## Start Using Notepad Again

 Hopefully, the solutions provided above have helped, and you’re able to use Notepad again. However, if none of the above solutions work, you can perform a system restore to undo any recent changes that may have caused the problem.
