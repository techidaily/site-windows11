## Navigating the Maze: Finding Windows 11'S MAC Addresses

 Every device that connects to the internet has a Media Access Control (MAC) address that uniquely identifies it online. Your Windows PC, smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch have a unique MAC address that allows it to communicate with other devices over the internet.

 The 12-character alphanumeric MAC address is defined within the network adapter of your device by the manufacturer. It is typically used to set up network routing protocols or send data across a network. You might also need it to customize your network.

 So, how do you find your Windows 11's MAC address? Read on to find out.

## 1\. Find Your Windows 11 PC's Wifi or Ethernet MAC Address From the Settings App

 The**Settings** app in Windows 11 is a massive upgrade in terms of usability and makes it easy to find a specific setting quickly. Here's how you can find your device’s MAC address via the Windows 11 Settings app:

1. Launch the**Start** menu, search for the**Settings** app, and select the Best match.
2. From the sidebar, choose**Network & internet** , and then select**Wi-Fi** or**Ethernet** from the network page.
3. Finally, select**Hardware properties** , and you will see the details of your network configuration.

4. At the bottom of the page, look for the**Physical address (MAC)** to find your alphanumeric MAC address string.

## 2\. Find Your Windows 11 MAC Address via the Command Prompt

 If you’re an old-school techie, you might prefer using[the Windows Command Prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/) as much as possible. Fortunately, you can quickly determine the MAC address of your Windows 11 device with just a single command as follows:

1. Launch the**Start** menu, search for the**Command Prompt** , and select the Best match. Alternatively, you can right-click the**Taskbar** and select**Terminal (Admin)** .
2. Type the below command and press**Enter**  
`ipconfig /all  
`

3. In the Windows IP Configuration, under the**Ethernet adapter** section, you can see your MAC address next to the**Physical Address** field.

 The Windows IP Configuration will show the network configuration details of Wifi, Ethernet, and any virtual machines you’ve set up. You can use the**Description** field to ensure you’re using the MAC address of the correct connection type.

## Can I Change the MAC Address on Windows 11?

 While it is possible to change the default MAC address of your Windows PC, device manufacturers strongly recommend against it as it can cause unexpected issues. Nevertheless, if you still want to change the MAC address of your device, make sure you’re aware of the possible implications before you get started.
