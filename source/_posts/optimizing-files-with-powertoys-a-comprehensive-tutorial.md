## Optimizing Files with PowerToys: A Comprehensive Tutorial

 If you are struggling to work out why a file is refusing to be deleted, File Locksmith could be the utility you need. This new addition to the PowerToys suite can help you understand unusual file behavior in a few clicks.

## What Is the File Locksmith?

 File Locksmith is a relatively new addition to the PowerToys suite of tools. It is a Windows Shell extension used for checking up on the files in use at a particular moment. It also lets you check which system processes are using those files.

 If you have yet to try PowerToys and the utilities it offers, you can download it from the[Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/microsoft-powertoys/XP89DCGQ3K6VLD) . File Locksmith was only added to the app in an update in late 2022\. If you don't see it in your current version of PowerToys, click the**General** tab and select**Check for Updates** .

 If this is your first counter with PowerToys, check out[how to do more with Windows using PowerToys](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-powertoys/) for some beginner's advice.

## When Is File Locksmith Most Useful?

 Although it might not seem so at first glance, File Locksmith is a very useful utility. Firstly, it can help you better understand which files are being used at any particular moment. It can also tell you why a file you are unsuccessfully trying to delete is being blocked.

 It can also be used to troubleshoot the apps and files that slow down your PC and find performance bottlenecks. When you use it alongside other[ways to troubleshoot and improve PC performance](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-faster-performance/) , it can help speed up your PC by quite a bit.

## How to Check Files and Processes in File Locksmith

 You can either check a single file or scan every file in a folder. If a folder has subdirectories, these will also be examined.

 File Locksmith should be enabled by default after being added to PowerToys during the update. If not, you can enable it by opening the PowerToys app, selecting the File Locksmith tab, and clicking the On button.

1. Open File Explorer and find the file or folder you want to check.
2. Right-click on the file/folder, and select**Show more options > What's using this file?**  
![Opening a file in File Locksmith on Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/file-locksmith-scan.jpg)
3. File Locksmith will open a window and begin scanning the file. Any processes being used will be displayed in the window.
