## Learn to Record Dual-Track Screenshots with Windows 11'S Snipping Tool (Max 156)

 The Snipping Tool is the native screen capture and video recording tool in Windows 11\. And now, Microsoft is testing an audio capture feature along with video in the Windows Insider channel. We will discuss this feature in detail and how to enable it on your Windows 11 PC. Let’s begin.

## The Snipping Tool Gets an Audio Recording Feature

 The Sniping Tool got a major facelift after getting video capture support in Windows 11\. After that came the [Text Actions feature](https://www.makeuseof.com/text-actions-snipping-tool-windows-11/) that can read text from screenshots, which is another useful add-on. You can already annotate the captured screenshots in the tool, so adding audio capture support makes it a complete package for users.

## How to Enable and Use the Audio Recording Feature in the Snipping Tool

 The Snipping Tool’s audio recording feature is limited to Windows Insider users at the time of writing. It is available for users enrolled in the Canary channel after a recent update, so you must first update your Windows PC to the latest available build and install it. Non-Insiders can use UUP Dump to [download the Windows Insider builds without enrolling in the program](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-download-insider-iso-without-insider-program/).

 After updating your PC, go to the Microsoft Store app and check for any available updates for the Snipping Tool. The audio recording feature is available in version 11.2309.16.0 of the app, so update to this or any higher version.

 First, you need to allow the Snipping Tool to use your system's microphone. Follow the steps below:

1. Press the **Win** key to open the **Start** menu. Type Snipping Tool and press the **Enter** key to launch the app.
2. Click on the **video record** icon to select it.
3. Click on the **New** button.

4. Click and drag the selection tool to highlight the area you want to record. You will notice two new icons in the top bar alongside the timer and Start button; these enable you to control the system audio recording and microphone audio recording.
5. Click on the **microphone** icon. You will have to allow the app to use your PC's microphone for audio recordings.
6. Then, click on the **Open Microphone privacy settings** option. Click on the **Yes** button to continue.

## Is the Audio Recording Feature Any Good?

 If you [use an external microphone](https://www.makeuseof.com/questions-ask-before-buying-external-microphone/), the quality of the audio capture is decent. Since you can select the audio input device and mute or unmute the audio capture while video recording, you also have the option to add a voiceover while recording a video, which you can use as a video guide.

 The Snipping Tool saves the video recording with the audio capture in MP4 format; it doesn’t create a separate file for the audio recording. But you can [use editing apps like Clipchamp](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-clipchamp-record-screen-camera/) to separate the audio recording from the video and then tweak it.

## Capture Audio Along With Your Screen

 The Snipping Tool is getting more love from Microsoft and the new audio recording feature makes it a decent app for recording video with audio. You don’t need to use third-party apps like OBS Studio anymore. However, it will take some time for the feature to become available to everyone.
