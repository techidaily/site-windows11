## Win 11 and Discord: Fixing The Deadly JS Error Quickly

 Discord may be popular, but it's useless when users can’t utilize it because of the “fatal Javascript error occurred” error. This fatal Javascript Discord error message typically pops up when users try to start that app. However, some users have reported that the issue can also arise when trying to install (or reinstall) Discord.

 Either way, the fatal Javascript error stops users from utilizing Discord. If you need to fix that issue on your Windows 11/10, try applying these fatal Javascript error solutions.

## 1\. Run Discord With Admin Rights

 Running Discord with administrative rights could potentially fix the fatal Javascript error. Then the software will have maximum system access (privileges for accessing restricted folders and changing files). You can set Discord to always run as administrator as covered within our guide for[running apps with admin rights on Windows](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/always-run-apps-administrator-windows/) .

## 2\. Uninstall BetterDiscord

 BetterDiscord is an extension for customizing the Discord app. However, some BetterDiscord custom scripts can cause Discord issues like the fatal JavaScript error. Furthermore, using that app doesn’t fall within Discord’s terms of service. If you have installed BetterDiscord, try removing that app as follows:

1. Open this[Discord Enhancement Project](https://betterdiscord.app/) page.
2. Click the**Download v1.5.3** button.
3. [Open File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) to go to the directory your browser downloads files to.
4. Double-click the**BetterDiscord-Windows.exe** file.
5. Then select the**I accept license agreement** option and click the**Next** button.
6. Select the**Uninstall BetterDiscord** option, and click**Next** again.  
![The Uninstall BetterDiscord option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/uninstall-betterdiscord-option.jpg)
7. Choose a**Discord** version.
8. Click**Uninstall** to finish.

## 3\. Delete Discord’s Data Folders

 The fatal Javascript error often arises because of corrupted Discord cache data. Fortunately, erasing a couple of Discord data folders will clear out any corruption.

 This is how you can eradicate Discord’s data folders on Windows:

1. Launch Task Manager, which has a**Ctrl** +**Shift** +**Enter** keyboard shortcut.
2. Click**Processes** if that tab doesn’t open with Task Manager.
3. Then look for any Discord-related processes.
4. Terminate all Discord-related processes by selecting them and clicking their**End task** options.  
![A Discord-related processes](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/discord-related-process.jpg)
5. Open Windows Explorer with**Win + E** .
6. Type**%appdata%** inside Explorer’s address bar and press**Return** .
7. Then select the Discord data folder and click Explorer's**Delete** option on the**Home** tab or command bar.  
![A discord folder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/discord-folder.jpg)
8. Input**%LocalAppData%** in Explorer’s address bar and press**Enter** .
9. Next, click the Discord folder with the mouse’s right button and select**Delete** .

## 4\. Reinstall Discord

 The Javascript error can be due to missing or corrupted Discord modules. If the error message lists specific modules as the culprit for this error, reinstalling Discord will restore all its modules. You can reinstall Discord via Settings like this:

1. Check out our guide for[how to open Apps & Features](https://www.makeuseof.com/9-ways-to-open-the-apps-features-tool-in-windows-11/) to bring up the uninstaller tool.
2. Click the menu button on the right side of the Discord app listed in Apps & Features to select**Uninstall** .
3. Then select**Uninstall** when prompted for app removal confirmation.  
![The Uninstall option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/uninstall-option2.jpg)
4. Delete leftover Discord app data subfolders as outlined for the third resolution.
5. Reboot your Windows PC before reinstalling the Discord software.
6. Open up the[download page for Discord](https://discord.com/download) .
7. Click**Download** **for Windows** to get the Discord setup wizard.  
![The Download for Windows option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/download-for-windows-button.jpg)
8. Next, double-click**DiscordSet.exe** in whatever file your browser downloaded it in.
9. Go through Discord’s installation wizard to reinstall the software.

## 5\. Disable Any Third-Party Antivirus Tools

 Conflicting third-party antivirus tools can also cause the fatal Javascript error by blocking some of Discord’s files. Avast Antivirus is one such utility known to conflict with Discord. If you’ve got that third-party software installed or another alternative, try disabling its shield before attempting to start (or install) Discord.

 The exact steps for disabling different third-party software packages vary. However, most of them have context menu options for disabling their shields. So, right-click your security software’s system tray icon to look for it and select an option that turns off its antivirus shield.

 Should that possible solution work, whitelisting (excluding) Discord in your antivirus software would be the next thing to do. Again, how you do that varies between software packages. Look for and open a whitelist (app exclusion list) within your antivirus tool’s settings tabs. Then select to exclude Discord from the antivirus protection from there.

 Windows also includes a pre-installed antivirus tool, but that’s not so widely reported to conflict with Discord. Nevertheless, you can still disable that app’s real-time antivirus scanning just to check. These are the steps for disabling Windows Security’s real-time scanning:

1. To access Windows Security, double-click its shield icon on the system tray.
2. Select**Virus & threat protection** on Windows Security’s**Home** tab.  
![The Virus & threat protection tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/virus-threat-protection.jpg)
3. Click**Manage Settings** to view the options.
4. Toggle off the**Real-time protection** option to disable background antivirus scanning.  
![The Real-time protection option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/real-time-protection-option.jpg)

## 6\. Check the Quality Windows Audio Video Experience Service is Enabled

 Quality Windows Audio Video Experience is a service for improving audio and video streaming performance. That’s an important service to have enabled and running for Discord. So, check that qWave is turned on and running as follows:

1. To access the app launcher in Windows, right-click**Start** (on the taskbar) and select the**Run** accessory shortcut.
2. Input**services.msc** inside Run’s**Open** command box.
3. Select**OK** to launch the Services app.  
![The Services app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-services-app.jpg)
4. Then double-click**Quality Windows Audio Video Experience** inside the Services window.
5. If Quality Windows Audio Video Experience is disabled, select the**Automatic** startup option.  
![The Startup type drop-down menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/the-startup-type-drop-down-menu.jpg)
6. Press the service’s**Start** button.
7. Select**Log On** at the top of the service’s properties window.  
![The Log On tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/this-account-radio-button.jpg)
8. Click**Browse** for the**This account** radio button.
9. Input your user account within the**Enter** object name box.
10. Click**OK** to close out of the Select user window.
11. To save the service’s new settings, select its**Apply** option.
12. Then exit the window by selecting**OK** .

## Start Chatting in Discord Again on Windows

 So, you don’t have to ditch Discord because of the fatal Javascript error. One of the above fatal Javascript error resolutions will likely resolve that issue on your PC since they’ve worked for many users.
