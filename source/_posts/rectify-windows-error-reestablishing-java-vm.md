## Rectify Windows Error: Reestablishing Java VM

 Your Windows 11 computer may require the latest version of Java installed for some applications to work. However, sometimes some Java apps may abruptly crash with the error Could not create the Java virtual machine.

 This error is often a case of insufficient memory allocation for Java apps. Additionally, check for permission issues and glitches with the Java release itself. If you are using it on your work computer for programming purposes, check if you have the correct version of Java IDE installed.

 Here we show you a few troubleshooting steps to fix the could not create the java virtual machine error on Windows.

## 1\. Verify Your Java Installation

![verify java installation command prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/verify-java-intallation-command-prompt.jpg)

 Verifying your Java installation can help you determine issues with the release itself. You can use the**java -version** command in Command Prompt to check the current version of Java installed along with the date of installation.

To check the Java version installed on Windows:

1. Press the**Win** key and type**cmd** .
2. Right-click on**Command Prompt** and select**Run as administrator** .
3. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press**Enter** :  
`java -version`
4. The output will list the JDK version installed on your computer and the installation date.
5. If you have recently installed an update, check if the information checks out. If not, try to install the latest version available from the[Java website](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/) .

## 2\. End the Java Process in Task Manager

![end java process task manager](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/end-java-process-task-manager.jpg)

 If the error is triggered when installing Java, check if a Java process is running in the background. You can use Task Manager to find and end background processes that may prevent you from installing the Java Runtime Environment or the development kit.

1. Press**Win + X** to open the**WinX menu** and select**Task Manager** .
2. In Task Manager, open the**Processes** tab and locate instances of**Java Virtual Machine** .
3. Select and click**End Task** to close the process.

## 3\. Run Java as an Administrator

 Insufficient permission can prevent some Java apps from running on your computer. To fix the problem, run Java with administrative privilege. To run Java as an administrator on Windows, right-click on**Java.exe** and select**Run as administrator** .

 Alternatively, you can set the Java.exe to always run as administrator. This way, you don’t need to run Java with administrative privileges each time you want to launch it. Check out[how to always run a program as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/always-run-apps-administrator-windows/) for more information.

## 4\. Increase the System Memory for Java

 A common reason for the Could not create the Java virtual machine error is insufficient memory allocation, also known as Java heaps. Insufficient memory allocation can throttle the performance or cause the app to crash.

 To remedy this issue, you can increase the Java heap size. You can do this by modifying the**Runtime Parameters** from**Java Runtime Environment Settings** or changing the**\_JAVA\_OPTIONS** variable value to your preference.

### How to Increase Java Heap Size by Manually Modifying Variables

To change Java heap size by modifying the \_JAVA\_OPTIONS variable:

1. Press the**Win** key and type**environmental variables** .  
![edit the system environmental variables](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/edit-the-system-environmental-variables.jpg)
2. Next, select**Edit the system environment variables** to open**System Properties** .
3. In the**Advanced** tab, click**Environment Variables** .  
![The Environment Variables button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/environment-variables-button.jpg)
4. In the**System Variables** section, click**New** . It is important to select the correct section.  
![Windows new system variable java options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/windows-new-system-variable-java-options.jpg)
5. Type**\-JAVA\_OPTIONS** in the**Variable name** field.
6. Next, type**\-Xmx512M** in the**Variable value** field. Here,**\-Xmx512M** defines the amount of memory you want to allocate. In this case, it is**512MB** of system memory.
7. Click**OK** , and**OK** once more to save the changes.

 Next, launch the app that shows the error and check if the error is resolved. If not, open**Environmental Variables** again. Select the -**JAVA\_OPTIONS** variable and click**Edit** . In the**Value data** field, type**\-Xmx1024M** to increase the memory size to 1**024 MB (1GB)** . Click**OK** and check for any improvements.

### How to Increase Java Heap Size Using the Java Control Panel

 You can also modify the default Java heap size from Java Runtime Environment Settings. Here’s how to do it.

1. Press**Win + R** to open**Run** .
2. Type**control** and click**OK** to open Control Panel.
3. Next, click on**Programs** and click on**Java (32-bit)** .
