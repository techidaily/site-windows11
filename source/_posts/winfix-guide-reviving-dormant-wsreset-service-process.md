## 1\. Run WSReset.exe as an Administrator

 WSReset.exe requires administrative privileges to run properly. If you're not running it as an administrator, it may fail to reset the Windows Store cache.

## 2\. Run the Windows Store App Troubleshooter

2. Select **System** from the left sidebar.
3. In the right pane, click **Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters**.
