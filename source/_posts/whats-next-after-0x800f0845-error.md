## 3\. Run the System File Checker and the DISM Tool

 Corrupted Windows system files could also be the cause of the 0x800f0845 error. To scan, repair, and replace such damaged files, run the System File Checker or SFC scan.

 And if the SFC doesn't work properly, and can’t repair your system files, you should run the DISM or Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool. DISM is a command-line tool that can be used to service and repair Windows images, including those used for Windows Recovery and Windows Setup.

 To know how to run the SFC and DSIM, you can explore our guide on[CHKSDK, SFC, and DISM, and how they work](https://www.makeuseof.com/difference-between-chkdsk-sfc-and-dism-in-windows-10/) .

 These scans will take a few minutes to run. If the 0x800f0845 error was caused by corrupted files, it should have been fixed. So try updating Windows again.

## 4\. Reset Windows Update Components

 Error 0x800f0845 could occur if some Windows Update components have got corrupted. You could reset Windows components to get the Windows update running fine again. Here's how:

[Open Windows Terminal](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-windows-terminal/) using one of the many ways. Or type**Windows Terminal** in**Windows Search** . Then, right-click**Windows Terminal** under**Best match** and select**Run as administrator.**

 First, you need to stop the update services. In the Windows Terminal window, type the following four commands one by one, making sure that you press**enter** after each command:

`net stop bits  
net stop wuauserv  
net stop appidsvc  
net stop cryptsvc`

 Then to set up a new SoftwareDistribution folder, you need to rename it. So enter the following command and press**enter** :

`Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old`

 Next, rename the catroot2 folder for Windows to set up a new one. Type the following command and press**enter** :

`Ren %systemroot%\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old`

 Finally, you need to restart the stopped services. Type the following four commands one after the other, while pressing**enter** after each command:

`net start bits  
net start wuauserv  
net start appidsvc  
net start cryptsvc`

 Once you have run all the commands, the update error should have got fixed. Restart your PC and try installing the updates again.
