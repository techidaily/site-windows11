## 1\. Notifications Help You Stay Informed About the Latest News, Emails, Messages, and More

![Windows 11 Desktop on an Ultrawide Monitor With App Tray, System Status, and Notifications](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/windows-11-desktop-on-an-ultrawide-monitor-with-app-tray-system-status-and-notifications.jpg)

 We often underestimate the importance of notifications in keeping us updated about the latest news, emails, messages, and much more. We get an idea about who sent a message without bothering to open the app. Notifications also brief you about what might be causing problems in your system.

 There are different types of notifications: some require actions, and some don't. They can be in various forms, including banners, pop-ups, and badges. You can see these types of notifications throughout the Windows 11 OS, or in any previous versions of Windows released in the recent past, for that matter.

 To turn on Notifications, open the Settings app, click **Notifications,** and then enable the **Notifications** toggle.

## 2\. You Can Perform Quick Actions Without Opening the App

![Screenshot showing actionable WhatsApp notification](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/actionable-notifications.jpg)

 Actionable notifications let you respond to events without launching the relevant app. You've likely already seen them; for example, you might have seen notifications for chat messages which you can reply to within the notification itself.

 When you turn on Notifications in Windows 11, you can quickly respond to messages without opening the messaging app. But actionable notifications are not just about replying to messages: they can remind you of something later in the day with your permission as well as allow you to ignore something altogether. Again, all of this can be done without opening the app.

 It is also important to note that all your notifications appear in Windows 11 Action Center, which opens from the right side of your screen. Here is [how to can fix Action Center if it's not opening](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-action-center-not-opening/).

## 3\. Notifications Help You Better Manage Your Time

 Time is something we all wish to have more, but since we haven't invented time travel, you need to manage it efficiently instead. Since notifications keep you updated with the latest information in the app, you may not feel the urgency to open apps to check something. This way, it saves you time and helps you stay focused on what's more important.

 Imagine a situation where you keep opening an app to stay updated with everything latest. It will be even worse if the app provides you with news — you will have to open it every time you want to check for what's happening. So, you are better off with Notifications enabled on your Windows 11 PC, as they save you time and keep you organized.

## 4\. You Can Control Which Apps Can Send You Notifications

![Disable the Toggle Next to Specific Apps in the Notifications From Apps and Other Senders Section in Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/disable-the-toggle-next-to-specific-apps-in-the-notifications-from-apps-and-other-senders-section-in-windows-settings-app.jpg)

 You may not want notifications from all apps even when you're not working. Windows 11 allows you to choose which apps you want notifications from. As a rule of thumb, never turn off notifications for apps that are super important to you. For example, if your organization uses Teams for communication, you should always allow Teams notifications to show up even when you're working so that you don't miss anything time-sensitive.

 You can tweak notifications from apps and other senders from the Notifications page in the Settings app.

## 5\. Notifications Help You Capture Better Screenshots

![Snipping-tool-notification-in-Windows-11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot-2023-07-08-111356.jpg)

 Windows 11 has a handy keyboard shortcut for taking screenshots on your PC. You can press the **Win key** \+ **Shift** \+ **S** on your keyboard to launch the Snipping tool and capture a window, the entire screen, or a portion of the screen.

 However, if you turn off the Notifications from the Settings app, you wouldn't know if the screenshot was captured. You will need to open the Snipping Tool app to check out and save the screenshot. This can be a massive pain point if you take screenshots regularly. Y

 ou can avoid all of this and get notified when a screenshot is captured and get an option to save it from the notification itself. It is also important to note that you may not be able to take screenshots with Notifications turned on. If that is the case, you can [fix the Snipping Tool not working on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-fix-snipping-tool-not-working/).

## 6\. Notifications Can Help You Stay Secure in Windows 11

 Security is one of the most important aspects of your computer, no matter which operating system you are running. Equally important is staying up to date with what's wrong with the security of your PC. The only easy way to get notified instantly about any compromise in security in Windows 11 is by enabling Notifications.

 Windows 11 will push notifications if the Microsoft Defender application in the OS detects malware, thus helping you take action before it's too late. If you turn off the **Notifications** toggle in Windows 11, you must open the Microsoft Defender security application to check if your system is infected with malware.

 To ensure your PC is less vulnerable to malware and other threats, you should learn [how to beef up Windows 11 security](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-improve-security/).
