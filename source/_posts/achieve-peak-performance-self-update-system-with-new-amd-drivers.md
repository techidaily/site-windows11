## Achieve Peak Performance: Self-Update System with New AMD Drivers

 AMD Software Adrenaline Edition on Windows lets you manage your AMD graphics card, game stats, perform driver updates, and more. Sometimes, after an update, it may fail to launch with the error Windows update has replaced your AMD graphics driver.

 The full error reads Windows update may have automatically replaced your AMD graphics driver. This error is due to a conflict between the AMD Software Adrenaline Edition driver and the UWP AMD graphics driver installed by Windows.

 To fix the problem, you’ll need to stop Windows from installing AMD Radeon drivers automatically and perform a manual reinstall. Here’s how to do it.

## Why Does Windows Automatically Replace Your AMD Graphics Drivers?

 By default, the Windows operating system installs the [Microsoft Basic Display Adapter](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-basic-display-adapter-guide/) during the initial setup. It provides display graphics capabilities so that you can set up your new computer and install the necessary drivers.

 This basic display driver lets you configure your discrete graphics with the latest drivers using AMD Software. It also acts as a backup when your discrete GPU driver faults causing [black screen issues on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-black-screen-on-windows-10-11/) .

 However, this error occurs when Windows updates install the UWP (Universal Windows Platform) driver for your AMD Radeon GPU. Since two versions of the same driver are installed, when you try to open the AMD Software Adrenaline Edition app it will trigger an error.

 AMD has addressed this issue and provided a quick fix. To fix the error, you'll need to stop Windows from automatically installing the AMD graphics drivers. Then, reinstall the AMD graphics driver using AMD software.

## 1\. Roll Back the AMD Graphics Driver

![amd radeon display adapter driver roll back](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/amd-radeon-display-adapter-driver-roll-back.jpg)

 An easy way to fix Windows replacing your AMD graphics error is to roll back the AMD graphics driver. A driver rollback removes the current driver and reinstalls the previous version saved on your computer. Fortunately, you can [roll back device drivers using the Windows Device Manager](http://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-10/) .

 In Device Manager, look for and expand the**Display Adapters** section. Here, select the**AMD Radeon (TM) graphics** device and perform a driver rollback. Once done, restart your computer and check for any improvements. If the**Roll Back Driver** option is greyed out, you can't perform a rollback for the selected device.

 Once the error is resolved, you'll need to stop Windows from automatically downloading AMD drivers. If not, you’ll likely encounter the same error after each Windows update.

 You can [stop automatic driver updates on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-stop-automatic-driver-updates/) using device installation settings,**Group Policy Editor** , and the**Windows Registry** . With the device installation settings for automatic driver download set to off, Windows won't download and install AMD graphics drivers automatically.
