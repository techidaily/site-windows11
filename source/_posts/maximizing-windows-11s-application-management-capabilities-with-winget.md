## Maximizing Windows 11'S Application Management Capabilities with Winget

 Winget is a command-line tool that can download and install app packages from MS Store and the apps available in its repository. Windows users yearned for a dedicated package manager built into the OS until Microsoft decided to give them one. It is better than using an additional package manager but not all users love the terminal.

 If you have used Winget even once, you know that knowing the correct commands is of absolute importance if you want to avoid errors. But what if you had a GUI version of Winget? WingetUI is one such app that slaps a coat of UI on Winget. Curious? Let’s begin.

## What Is WingetUI, and How Is It Different From Winget?

 WingetUI is a GUI implementation of the [Winget](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-download-install-and-use-the-windows-package-manager-winget/)tool that makes it super easy to manage app packages. It also supports Scoop and Chocolatey and can act as GUI forefront for all these three tools. If you'd like to know more about those, check out our [comparison between Chocolatey and Windows Package Manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/chocolatey-vs-windows-package-manager/), and [how to install Scoop on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-install-scoop/).

 Currently, WingetUI offers more than 4700 packages for Winget. If you combine the package list for all three package managers (including Chocolatey and [Scoop](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-install-scoop/)), the numbers stand at a staggering 14000\.

 So, you can directly access 14000 packages without leaving the app and will have to rarely search the web. WingetUI can help you to manage all the installed packages, discover and install new ones, [batch install multiple packages](https://www.makeuseof.com/export-import-apps-winget-in-windows-11/), export or import package list, search for packages inside the app, and more.

 The fun doesn’t stop there. You can switch to dark mode in the app, and it even notifies you about the app updates whenever you launch the app and can even auto-update them. Furthermore, you can even view the package details, and its commands, and can share the packages with your friends.

## How to Download and Install WingetUI on Windows11

 WingetUI is available on GitHub and also has a dedicated website to keep you updated about the new features. However, you will find the download links on [GitHub](https://github.com/marticliment/WingetUI/releases/latest), Softpedia, and Uptodown only. Download the installer file from any of these hosts and then install it on your PC. Make note that WingetUI only works with Windows 10 and Windows 11 (64-bit versions only).

 After the installation completes, the app will ask you to select the package managers you want to use. Select the **Enable Winget** option for now, and click on the **Apply and Start WingetUI** button.

## No More Terminal Woes

 WingetUi makes it easy for the average Joe to manage app packages on a Windows PC. There is a similar web-based GUI package manager called Winstall for batch-installing apps, but it only generates codes for it. You will have to manually run the commands in the Terminal. So, you can use WingetUI instead if you want zero interaction with Windows Terminal.

 If you have used Winget even once, you know that knowing the correct commands is of absolute importance if you want to avoid errors. But what if you had a GUI version of Winget? WingetUI is one such app that slaps a coat of UI on Winget. Curious? Let’s begin.
