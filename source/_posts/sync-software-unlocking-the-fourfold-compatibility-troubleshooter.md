## Sync Software: Unlocking the Fourfold Compatibility Troubleshooter

 Just because developers built an app for an older version of Windows, it doesn’t mean you can’t run it on a newer version of the OS. Through compatibility mode, you can easily run old programs without any issues a majority of the time.

 If you run into compatibility issues, however, don't fret. Windows has a built-in tool that allows you to diagnose and fix them with ease. It’s called the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter, and we’re going to show you all the different ways that you can fire it up.

## 1\. Run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter Using the Context Menu

 The easiest way to run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter on Windows 10 is to simply right-click an app and select**Troubleshoot compatibility** . If you’re on Windows 11, you’ll have to click**Show more options** first after you right-click the app to bring back the classic context menu, and then select**Troubleshoot compatibility** .
