## Method for Handling Device Access Issues with Audacity (Win)

 Audacity is usually great software for editing audio. However, it’s not so wonderful when the “error while opening sound device” error occurs. Some users see that error message when they select to record or play in Audacity.

 Audacity isn’t much use when you can’t record or play music with the software because of the “error while opening sound device” issue. There are numerous ways you can feasibly resolve that Audacity recording/playback error in Windows. This is how you can fix the “error while opening sound device” issue.

## 1\. Enable Desktop Apps to Access Microphone

 You can’t record with Audacity if microphone access for that app is disabled. So, the first thing you should check is the microphone access settings in Windows. Check the microphone is enabled for Audacity like this:

1. Activate the Windows Start menu and click the**Settings** button or pinned shortcut.
2. Next, click a**Privacy** tab or category within the Settings window.
3. Select the**Microphone app permission** option.

4. Toggle on the**Microphone access** option if you find that setting disabled.
5. Scroll down to Audacity on the app list below the**Microphone access** option.

6. Click Audacity’s toggle switch on if it’s off to enable mic access for that app.

## 2\. Check Sound Devices Are Enabled

 The “Error while opening sound device” issue can arise because playback or recording devices are disabled. So, make sure the devices you’re trying to utilize with Audacity are fully enabled and set to default. This is how you can check your sound devices are enabled in Windows:

1. Open Run with its**Win + R** shortcut.
2. Then input**mmsys.cpl** inside Run’s command box.
3. Select**OK** to bring up a Sound window.
4. If the**Playback** tab shows a peripheral you’re trying to utilize in Audacity is disabled, right-click that device and select**Enable** .
5. Click**Recording** to switch to that tab.
6. Right-click the input recording device you want to utilize and select**Enable** if disabled.
