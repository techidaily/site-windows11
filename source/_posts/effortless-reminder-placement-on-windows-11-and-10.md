## Effortless Reminder Placement on Windows 11 & 10

 You can add notes to the Windows 11/10 desktop with Sticky Notes. However, you can't add any notes to software windows with that accessory. That's a pity since such a feature would enable you to stick all kinds of instructional and hotkey notes for apps to their windows, not to mention task reminders, etc.

 However, Stick A Note and Notezilla are two third-party apps with which you can stick notes to software windows, which we'll look at here.

 Or you can set Stick A Note to automatically show notes after opening software windows. To do so, right-click the program's system tray icon and select**Settings** . Select the**Auto Show Note for the Active Program** checkbox, and click the**OK** option.
