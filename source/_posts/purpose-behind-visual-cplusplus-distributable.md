## Purpose Behind Visual C++ Distributable

 The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is a crucial component when it comes to Windows applications. It ensures that the programs built with the Microsoft Visual C++ programming language can run smoothly on your computer.

 Below, we explore the purpose of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable, how it works, and considerations when uninstalling it.

## What Is the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable?

 Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable is a collection of components and libraries that are used to run applications developed using the Microsoft Visual C++ programming language. This programming language is typically used to develop applications for Windows.

 There are different versions of Visual C++ Redistributable available. This means that when you install an application in Windows that is developed using Visual C++, it may require specific versions of the Redistributable to run on your computer. The installation of these versions will ensure that the app can run without any missing dependencies or compatibility issues.

## How Does It Work?

 The Visual C++ Redistributable works by providing the required components and libraries to the programs developed using Microsoft Visual C++.

 When you install such a program, Visual C++ Redistributable checks the system to see if the required version of the Redistributable is already installed on your computer. In case the version is missing or corrupt, it will prompt you to take necessary action.

 Once you have the required version, the Redistributable will add the essential runtime components (such as DLL files) in different system folders. These components have the code that programs need to run properly.

 This way, when you will attempt to run the targeted application, the program will scan the system for the required runtime components and once it locates them, it will function as it is supposed to.

 If certain applications on your computer require different versions of the Redistributable, the Redistributable package also ensures that the programs can access their corresponding versions without any conflicts.

 Visual C++ Redistributable is also regularly updated by Microsoft to address any bugs or performance issues. These updates are often equipped with the latest versions of the runtime components to ensure a smooth user experience.

 Yes, you can uninstall Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable from your system, but it is important to note that doing so can have consequences for the applications that rely on the packages to function.

 While uninstalling it is not recommended, here are a few scenarios where it might be needed:

* **Troubleshooting**: If you are experiencing issues while running specific applications and suspect that the Visual C++ Redistributable is causing the problem, you can consider uninstalling the current version and replacing it with the new, compatible one. However, we strongly recommend verifying that the issue is indeed related to the Redistributable before you proceed with the uninstallation.
* **Conflicting Versions**: If your system has multiple conflicting versions of the Visual C++ Redistributable, it can lead to different compatibility issues. You can address these problems by removing the problematic version.
* **Disk Space Management**: In case you are running low on disk space, you can consider uninstalling the Visual C++ Redistributable versions that are no longer used by applications. Again, it is important to ensure you are not removing the version that is critical for the programs to run.

 If you are encountering issues with the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable itself, it is best to start troubleshooting by ensuring the [Windows Installer service is running smoothly](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-visual-c-0x80240017-error/). It is also important to [keep the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package updated](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-runtime-errrors/) to prevent problems.
