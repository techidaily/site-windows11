## Jolly Windows 11 Makeover: 7 Tips and Tricks

 The holiday spirit can be infectious, and if you find yourself decorating every inch of your house with Christmas decorations, why not see how you can customize your Windows install as well?

 Here are a few ways to Christmas-ify Windows 11, so you're ready for the season.

## Adding Christmas Flair to Windows 11

 So how do you go about decorating your system? With themes, apps, and widgets, of course.

 Most items on this list are free and easy to set up, though just like real Christmas decorations, you'll want to revert these changes eventually.

 Some items on this list may be a little more vibrant than you'd usually want on your system, but if you're ready to dive into Christmas with everything you got, let's have a look at how you can bring a little festive flair to Windows 11.
