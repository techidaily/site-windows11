## What Is Taskbar Icon Grouping?

 Icon grouping is when Windows 11 combines multiple windows of a single program together. For example, having multiple File Explorer windows open will show as one File Explorer icon with multiple tabs behind it.

 This results in a cleaner and less cluttered taskbar, but one that gives you significantly less information. Some users [restore the old taskbar labels on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-10-taskbar-labels/), but this takes up more space on your taskbar than the icons do.
