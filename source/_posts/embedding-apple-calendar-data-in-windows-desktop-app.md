## 1\. Apple iCloud

[iCloud](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-icloud/) is an Apple service that keeps all your critical data on the cloud.

* As soon as you click on**Allow** from above, you'll get a verification code. Note it down.

 That’s it. Follow the above steps, and you’ll be inside the Calendar web app. You’ll get a view like this:
