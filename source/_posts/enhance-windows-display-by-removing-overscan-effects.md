## Enhance Windows Display by Removing Overscan Effects

 Is the display on your Windows computer getting cut off or extending beyond the visible screen area? This can make it difficult to read content near the edges or click on buttons and options.

 Fortunately, it’s possible to fix the overscanning or overscaling issues in Windows so that all the content is visible. This guide will walk you through the process.

## 1\. Disconnect and Reconnect the Display

 Overscanning problems on Windows can arise from a poorly connected [HDMI or DisplayPort](https://www.makeuseof.com/displayport-vs-hdmi/) cable. This can cause the screen image to appear stretched or cut off. Hence, the first thing you should do is disconnect and reconnect the display.

 Turn off your monitor or TV and unplug the HDMI or DisplayPort cable. Wait a few seconds, and then plug the cable back in. While you’re at it, ensure that both the cable's connector and the port are clean and free from any visible dust to ensure a secure connection.

## 2\. Change the Display Resolution

 Although Windows can automatically detect and adjust the resolution of a connected display, it may encounter difficulties at times. This can lead to overscanning or other display-related problems. In such cases, you can attempt to fix the issue by manually adjusting the display resolution.

 Follow these steps to continue:

1. Open the **Start menu** and click the gear-shaped icon to launch the Settings app.
2. Select the **System** tab and click on **Display**.
3. Click the drop-down menu next to **Display resolution** to select the correct resolution from the list. If you don’t know the appropriate display resolution for your display, refer to the product manual or experiment with different options.

 When attempting this fix, some users report having their screen resolution settings appear grayed out. If such is the case for you too, check our guide on [fixing inaccessible screen resolution settings on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-inaccessible-screen-resolution-settings/).

## 3\. Change the Display Scale

 Opting for an incorrect display scale may result in certain desktop elements being cropped or extending beyond the visible screen area, leading to an overscaled display. To fix this, you need to adjust the display scale on Windows using the steps below:

1. Press **Win + I** to [open the Windows Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/).
2. Head to **System > Display**.
3. Click the drop-down menu next to **Scale** to select the **Recommended** value.

 After changing the display scale, disconnect and reconnect the display and check if the issue is resolved.

## 4\. Use the Graphics Control Panel

 If adjusting the display resolution and scale via the Windows Settings app proves ineffective, you can try using the built-in graphics control panel to apply the changes. The exact steps will vary depending on whether your PC is equipped with Intel, NVIDIA, or AMD graphics.

 Here's how you can use the graphics control panels for each type:

### Fix Overscanning Using the Intel Graphics Command Center

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **Intel Graphics Command Center** in the box and press **Enter**.
3. Select **Display** from the left pane.
4. Select the monitor that is showing the overscan issue.
5. Under the **General** tab, click the drop-down menu next to **Scale** and select **Custom**.
6. Use the two sliders that appear on your left to adjust the display so that the screen fits.
7. Click **X** to close the window.

### Fix Overscanning Using the NVIDIA Control Panel

1. Open the **NVIDIA Control Panel** using the search menu.
2. Double-click the **Display** menu in the left pane to expand it.
3. Select **Adjust display size and position** from the **Display** section.
4. In the right pane, switch to the **Size** tab and tick the **Enable desktop resizing checkbox**.

 Once you make the necessary adjustments using the above steps, the issue should not occur again.

## 5\. Adjust Your Monitor’s Display Settings

 Most modern monitors include settings that let you customize display parameters like resolution, aspect ratio, scaling, and more. You can access the On-Screen Display (OSD) menu using the physical buttons or a remote.

 Look for settings such as "Auto Adjust," "Screen Fit," "1:1," or "Scaling" on the menu. Experiment with different options and see if they help resolve overscanning or overscaling issues on your Windows PC.

## 6\. Run the Display Calibration Tool

 Both Windows 10 and 11 offer a display calibration tool that can help you fix various display-related issues, including this one. Here's how you can run it.

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **Calibrate Display Color** in the search box and select the first result that appears.
3. In the **Display Color Calibration** window, follow the on-screen prompts.

 Complete the calibration process and see if the overscanning issue still occurs on Windows.

## 7\. Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter

 Another thing you can do to fix the overscaling issue on Windows is to run the built-in Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. Follow these steps to continue with this solution:

1. Right-click on the **Start icon** or use the **Win + X** keyboard shortcut to access the Power User menu.
2. Select **Terminal (Admin)** from the list.
3. Click **Yes** in the User Account Control prompt.
4. In the console, paste the following command and hit **Enter**.  
`msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic`
5. Click the **Advanced** option and tick the checkbox that reads **Apply repairs automatically**.
6. Click **Next** to run the troubleshooter.

 Wait for the troubleshooter to find and fix any issues, and see if the issue persists.
