## The Essential Guide to Clearing Restrictions via PowerShell

 So you’ve downloaded files onto a directory on your PC, but Windows doesn’t trust them? This is understandable because some files from the internet can harm your computer, but what if you know for sure that the files are safe? Luckily there’s an easy PowerShell command you can use to unblock all of them.

## How Do I Unblock Multiple Files Using PowerShell on Windows?

 You can easily unblock a file by right-clicking on it and going to**Properties** — If you're on Windows 11, you'll need to click**Show more options** first before you can see the**Properties** option in the context menu. And once you're there, select the**General** tab and tick**Unblock** at the bottom in the**Security** section.

 But what if you have more than one file you need to unblock? Doing this one by one can get tedious. Alternatively, you can execute a single PowerShell command to unblock multiple files in a directory. Here is the command structure you need to use:

`dir [path] | unblock-file -confirm`

 Just replace**path** in the square brackets with the file path of the directory that has the blocked files. You can grab the file path of the directory by right-clicking on it and selecting**Copy as path** .

 With the file path handy, follow the instructions below to use the unblock command in PowerShell:

1. Press**Win + S** to open Windows Search.
2. Type**powershell** in the search box and when the program appears in the search results, right-click on it and select**Run as administrator** . For more ways to open it, please read our guide on[ways to open PowerShell on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-command-prompt-powershell/) .
3. Enter the unblock command in PowerShell and hit the**Enter** key to run it. This is what it looks like on our computer:

4. You will be asked to confirm each file you want to unblock, so type either**Y** for**Yes** or**N** for**No** and hit the**Enter** key. This confirmation step is due to the**\-confirm** portion of the command. It is completely optional, and you can omit it or type**A** to confirm all the files in the directory.

 There’s a way you can tell Windows to always trust files you download from the internet. To do that, please read our guide on[how to stop Windows 10 from blocking your downloaded files](https://www.makeuseof.com/stop-windows-10-from-blocking-your-downloaded-files/) . The instructions in the tutorial use the Registry Editor and Local Group Policy Editor, so they should also work on Windows 11.
