## A Glimpse at Future-Ready Windows with Update #22H2's Features

 Windows 11 currently provides a more feature-rich experience since it was launched. The upcoming Windows 11 22H2 Moment update might add to the enhancements.

 Moment is the internal codename Microsoft uses internally to deliver new features and improvements to Windows 11, version 22H2\. Windows 11's next feature update will come via Moment 2, which is rumored to arrive next month. And we are putting together a list of what you might expect from it.

## 1\. A Tablet-Optimized Taskbar

 Microsoft will introduce a tablet-optimized taskbar thanks to a long-standing demand from Windows tablet users. Windows 11-powered tablets will get two taskbar modes: "**Collapsed** " and "**Expanded** ." The taskbar in the "Expanded" state features bigger icons, making it touch-friendly and best suited for tablet computers.

 The "Collapsed" state will be as minimal as possible. It will hide all the icons and show only essential ones, like the battery indicator. Swiping up and down on the bottom of your device will switch between two taskbar states. This functionality will be limited to tablets and convertibles only.

## 2\. A Floating Taskbar Similar to the macOS Dock

 Microsoft accidentally showed a floating taskbar in Windows 11 during a presentation at the Ignite event last year. A floating taskbar looks very similar to the macOS dock, except that the former features a less-rounded design.

 Since Microsoft has not yet introduced the macOS dock-inspired taskbar to Windows 11 Insider builds, the question of whether it will be possible to move the taskbar to several positions remains unanswered. Either way, the floating taskbar appears to be going through internal testing at this moment. Once ready, Microsoft could release it for Windows 11 Insiders and eventually for the general public via Moment updates.

## 3\. Tabbed Interface in Notepad

![Tabbed interface in Notepad](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tabbed-interface-in-notepad-2.jpg)

 Microsoft introduced File Explorer tabs in the Windows 11 22H2 update last year. Tabs support might expand to the Notepad app as well. Microsoft is currently testing tabs in Notepad with Windows 11 Insiders, hinting that it has a high chance of becoming available in upcoming Moment updates.

 Just like how[File Explorer allows you to open multiple tabs](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-file-explorer-tab-guide/) within it, the tabbed interface in Notepad will enable you to open multiple folders and directories in one single app window. For every single folder or directory, you can have a tab, thus making it easier for you to switch between them instead of opening a new app window for each.

## 4\. Animated Icons in the Settings App

 Support for animated icons in the Settings app could be another addition to the exciting features coming to Windows 11\. Animated icons in the Settings app will play animation every time you click them.

 Every animation will have a unique visual effect that's true to the nature of the icons. For example, the icon for the**Windows Update** setting will spin around whenever you click on it, whereas the icon for**Network & internet** will fill itself up upon clicking. Microsoft is currently A/B testing the animated Settings icon with select Windows 11 Insiders.

## 5\. Built-in Screen Recording

![Snipping tool with screen recording](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/snipping-tool-with-screen-recording.jpg)

 Snipping Tool is Windows 11's in-built screenshot capture application. However, the tool will not be limited to capturing only screenshots in the future. Microsoft is currently testing the ability to create screen recordings in the Snipping Tool app with Windows 11 Dev Channel Insiders. The likelihood is that a new Snipping Tool with screen recording capability will be available in the next Windows 11 Moment 2 update.

 The Snipping Tool will let you select the part of your screen you want to record before your PC starts the recording session. Then, once the recording is complete, you can preview, save, and share the clip. Remember, Snipping Tool's screen recording capability does not include audio recording. See our[guide to the Snipping Tool in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-snipping-tool/) if you're not familiar with it yet.

## 6\. New Dark Mode Toggle

 A dark mode toggle in Windows 11 Quick Setting panel was recently spotted in Insider builds. The new dark mode toggle will allow you to turn on or off dark mode whenever you like without opening the Settings app, which is very similar to how you can turn on or off dark mode quickly from the notification panel of your Android phone.

 As things stand currently, the dark mode toggle is available only in the Settings app. And if you are unaware of how to turn it on, you check our[guide on enabling dark mode in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-dark-mode/) .

## 7\. Task Manager Improvements

![Windows 11 Task Manager search bar](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/windows-11-task-manager-search-bar.jpg)

 Task Manager in Windows 11 shows you information on applications and processes on your computer. It is also where you can get a good idea about your PC's current state. However, finding one particular process or application that may need your attention when you run into trouble is quite a task.

 An improved Task Manager that Microsoft is currently testing with Insiders has a new search bar to help look up the exact process or application within seconds. In the new Task Manager search bar, you can search with a name, publisher, or process identification number (PID). Microsoft may introduce the new search bar to the upcoming Moment 2 or 3 updates, set to release this year.

## Features Coming to Windows 11 22H2 Moment Update

 The capabilities above have a high chance of getting into the list of features that Microsoft will introduce in Moment 2\. But we can not rule out the possibility of some features not making it to the final release. Therefore, they may be split across Moment 3 and subsequent updates.
