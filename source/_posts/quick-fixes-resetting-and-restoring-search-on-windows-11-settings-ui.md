![Restart Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/restart-windows-11-edit.jpg)

 A restart can fix many issues that are plaguing your system. When you restart your PC, you are essentially instructing it to start with a clean slate, leaving behind issues that might be causing trouble. Restarting your PC can also fix the Search issue in the Settings app.

 However, if your PC frequently requires a restart to fix this issue, the underlying problem affecting the Search feature in the Settings app persists. In that case, you should look for a more robust solution.

![Windows 11 Update setting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/windows-update-edit.jpg)

 Besides new features, software updates are meant to improve performance by fixing issues impacting your PC. While it can happen to anyone, a dysfunctional Search can be pretty common if you are running a Windows 11 Insider build. Either way, if you are seeing a software update on the**Windows Update** page in the Settings app, you should install it to see if it fixes the issue.

 If you're not sure how to do this, check out[how to install Windows 11 updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-install-updates/) for more info.

## 3\. Run the Search and Indexing Troubleshooter

![Search and indexing troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/search-and-indexing-troubleshoot-edit.jpg)

 Search indexing is the process in which your PC looks at files, folders, and other content that are there in the system. Getting errors while searching for specific settings could be the result of the malfunctioning of the Search indexing. If the above solutions do not fix the Search issue, you should run this troubleshooter from the Settings app. You can run it by following the below steps:

1. Open the**Settings** app by pressing**Win + I** on your keyboard.
2. Go to**System** \>**Troubleshoot** \>**Other troubleshooters** .
3. Scroll down until you find**Search and Indexing** .
4. Click**Run** , which is on the right side of**Search and Indexing** .

 The troubleshooter will look for the root cause of the issue and offer you solutions. Now, follow the fixes it recommends and see if the problem is gone.

## 4\. Reset the Settings App

 You can troubleshoot whatever is causing the Search issue in the Settings app by resetting or repairing it. A reset will take the Settings app to a normal state, though the app data will be deleted.

To reset or repair the Settings app, follow the below steps:

1. Click the Start icon and type "Settings."
2. Right-click on**Settings** , and then click**App settings** .
