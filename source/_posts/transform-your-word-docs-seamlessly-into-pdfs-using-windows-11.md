## Transform Your Word Docs Seamlessly Into PDFs Using Windows 11

 You can open Microsoft Word’s DOCX files with many word processors, but they won’t always look the same across different software packages. Not all word processors support the same formatting as Word. Consequently, DOCX files can sometimes look a bit (maybe even very) different when viewed in other software, especially on non-Windows devices.

 Fortunately, you can convert DOCX files into the universal PDF file format will ensure they look the same for whomever you share documents with. PDF is a universal file format that preserves original formatting and page layout. This is how you can convert DOCX files to PDFs in Windows 11\.

## How to Convert DOCX Files to PDF With a Web App

 You can only export one DOCX file at a time to the PDF format with the MS Word method. It’s better to utilize a web app if you need to convert multiple DOCX files to PDFs.

1. Open the [Online2PDF DOCX to PDF app](https://online2pdf.com/convert-docx-to-pdf) in your browser.  
![The Online2PDF DOCX to PDF web app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/online-2-pdf-web-app.jpg)
2. Click **Select Files** to choose the MS Word documents to convert.
3. Select **Convert files separately** in the **Mode** drop-down menu.  
![The Convert option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/convert-option.jpg)
