## Transform Your Word Docs Seamlessly Into PDFs Using Windows 11

 You can open Microsoft Word’s DOCX files with many word processors, but they won’t always look the same across different software packages. Not all word processors support the same formatting as Word. Consequently, DOCX files can sometimes look a bit (maybe even very) different when viewed in other software, especially on non-Windows devices.

 Fortunately, you can convert DOCX files into the universal PDF file format will ensure they look the same for whomever you share documents with. PDF is a universal file format that preserves original formatting and page layout. This is how you can convert DOCX files to PDFs in Windows 11\.

## How to Convert DOCX Files Into PDF With Microsoft Word

 If you have Microsoft Word installed with an active subscription, you can convert DOCX files to PDF format with that software. Word includes an option for creating XPS and PDF documents.

 You can convert DOCX files to PDF with that option as follows:

1. Open a DOCX file to convert to PDF with Microsoft Word.
2. Click **File** on the far left of Word’s tab bar.
3. Select **Export** in the **File** tab.
4. Then click **Create PDF/XPS Document**.  
![The Create PDF/XPS option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/export-option.jpg)
5. Input a file name in the text box.
6. Choose a directory to save the converted PDF in.  
![The Publish button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/publish-option.jpg)
7. Click **Publish** to save the converted Word PDF document. That PDF will then automatically open in the Edge browser, which all Windows users can view the file with.

 An alternative method is to save the document as a PDF file in Word. To do that, click **File** and **Save as**; select **Browse** to view the Save as window and choose a folder in which to include the PDF from there. Click on the **Save as type** drop-down menu to select PDF. Then select **Save** to finish.

## How to Convert DOCX Files to PDF With a Web App

 You can only export one DOCX file at a time to the PDF format with the MS Word method. It’s better to utilize a web app if you need to convert multiple DOCX files to PDFs.

 The Online2PDF.com website includes a DOCX to PDF conversion tool, with which you can bulk convert up to 20 files. This is how you can convert DOCX files to PDF with the Online2PDF.com app:

1. Open the [Online2PDF DOCX to PDF app](https://online2pdf.com/convert-docx-to-pdf) in your browser.  
![The Online2PDF DOCX to PDF web app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/online-2-pdf-web-app.jpg)
2. Click **Select Files** to choose the MS Word documents to convert.
3. Select **Convert files separately** in the **Mode** drop-down menu.  
![The Convert option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/convert-option.jpg)
4. Press **Convert** to initialize the conversion.

 The files should then automatically download to whatever folder location your browser is set to. That directory will probably be your user Downloads folder by default.

 When you convert multiple files, one ZIP archive will include all the PDF documents. You’ll need to [unzip the ZIP file](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/) to access the PDF documents it contains.

## How to Convert DOCX Files to PDF With Microsoft Edge

 Microsoft Edge is Windows 11’s pre-installed browser app. Although Edge doesn’t include a built-in DOCX to PDF converter, you can add such a tool to that browser with the Word to PDF extension.

 These are the steps for converting DOCX files to PDF documents with that extension:

1. Open this [Word to PDF extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/word-to-pdf/bihaecmofejdeinfhgcbcepglcclmeoh) page in Edge.
2. Click **Get** to add Word to PDF to Edge.
3. Next, click Edge’s **Extensions** button and select Word to PDF. If that button isn’t enabled, click **Word to PDF** on Edge’s URL toolbar.
4. Press the **From your PC** button.
