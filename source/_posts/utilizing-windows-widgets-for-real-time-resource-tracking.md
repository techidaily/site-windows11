## Utilizing Windows Widgets for Real-Time Resource Tracking

 If you care about how your PC performs, it's a good idea to set up some hardware monitors to keep an eye on things. Fortunately, Microsoft has added Windows widgets into Dev Home, providing real-time insights into system resources and empowering users to fine-tune their devices.

 Below, we delve into the process of acquiring Windows Widgets offered by Dev Home and harnessing their power to effectively monitor and optimize the system's performance.

[Dev Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/dev-home-windows-11-introduction/) is a specialized app created for software developers who use Windows 11\. Think of it as a central hub that provides a customizable workspace, allowing the developers to configure their machines, install the necessary software and packages, and connect to other platforms like GitHub.

 You can use it to create an environment tailored to your needs, whether it is to code for an existing project or start something new.

 Within Dev Home, you'll find a customizable dashboard equipped with widgets that offer valuable insights into your system resources. These widgets cover essential aspects such as:

* **Memory**: Keep track of memory usage, availability, and pool sizes.
* **Network**: Monitor bandwidth usage for data transfer and identify the active network.
* **CPU**: Stay informed about CPU utilization, processing speed, and active processes.
* **GPU**: Get updates on GPU utilization, temperature, and the model of the graphics chip.

 These widgets serve as handy tools to closely monitor and optimize your system's performance. To access them, simply [download Dev Home from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/dev-home-preview/9N8MHTPHNGVV) and set it up.

## How to Set Up and Configure Windows Widgets on Dev Home

 After downloading Dev Home in Windows 11, it is time to set up and configure the widgets. Here is how you can do that:

1. Press the **Win** \+ **X** keys together to open the Widgets window.
