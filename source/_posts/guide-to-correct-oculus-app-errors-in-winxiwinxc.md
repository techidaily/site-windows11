## Guide to Correct Oculus App Errors in WinXI/WinXC

 The Oculus Windows app is essential software for Rift users who must connect their virtual reality headsets to PCs. It’s also important for Quest 2 users who want to utilize apps and play games from the Rift storefront within their VR headsets.

 However, some users can’t install the Oculus Windows app because of an error message that says, “Sorry, we encountered an error during installation.” Users can’t utilize Rift headsets without that software installed. Quest 2 users can’t play Rift PC VR games because of this issue. This is how you can fix the “we encountered an error” Oculus app installation issue.

## 1\. Disconnect Your Quest 2/Rift Headset From Your PC Before Installing Oculus

 Some users have said they resolved the “we encountered an error” installation issue by disconnecting their VR headsets before running the Oculus installer. So, make sure your Rift or Quest 2 headset isn’t connected to your PC. Then try installing the Oculus software without the VR headset connected to your PC.

## 2\. Run the Oculus Installer File With Administrative Rights

 Some Windows programs require admin permission for installation. So, try running the Oculus installer file as an administrator to give it full system access. You can do that by right-clicking the **OculusSetup.exe** file and selecting **Run as administrator**.

## 3\. Deselect the Use Proxy Server Checkbox

 Disabling proxy servers is another fix a few Oculus app users confirm can fix the “we encountered an error” installation issue. You can deselect the **Use a proxy server** checkbox within Internet Properties. Our [guide to disabling proxy settings in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-proxy/) includes step-by-step instructions for how you can deselect that setting.

## 4\. Temporarily Disable Microsoft Defender (or Third-Party Antivirus)

 Real-time antivirus scanning can cause the “we encountered an error” issue to occur. Temporarily disabling antivirus protection on your PC will ensure it can’t block the Oculus software installation. This [how-to-turn-off Windows Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-off-windows-defender/) article includes instructions for disabling the Microsoft Defender antivirus.

![The Real-time protection option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/real-time-protection-option-1.jpg)

 If you utilize third-party antivirus software, turn off that app’s antivirus shield. Right-click a system tray icon for the antivirus software and select an option that will turn off its real-time antivirus shield (preferably for no longer than 30-60 minutes). Then try installing Oculus with your antivirus protection turned off.

## 5\. Turn Off the Windows Firewall

![The Turn off Windows Defender Firewall option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/turn-off-windows-defender-firewall-1.jpg)

 The Windows firewall can disrupt the Oculus server connection required for the software installation. So, temporarily disable the Microsoft Defender Firewall before installing the Oculus app. Check out this [how-to turn off Microsoft Defender Firewall guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-microsoft-defender-firewall/) for instructions about how to do so. Then have another go at installing the Oculus software with the firewall disabled.

## 6\. Install .NET Framework 4.6.1

 It has also been confirmed by Oculus users that installing .NET Framework 4.6.1 can fix the “we encountered an error” installation issue. This is how you can install .NET Framework 4.6.1:

1. Open this [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=49981) webpage.
2. Click the **Download** option for .NET Framework 4.6.1.

## 7\. Remove Leftovers From a Previous Oculus App Installation

 If you’re trying to reinstall the Oculus app after uninstalling it, removing leftover debris from the previous installation might resolve this issue. This means manually deleting Oculus folders left behind from the previous installation. You can erase leftover Oculus folders as follows:

1. Simultaneously press the **Windows** logo + **X** keys and select to open Run from the Power User menu.
2. Input **%appdata%** inside Run and click **OK**.
3. Right-click any Oculus subfolder in the **Roaming** directory and select **Delete**.
