## Halt Spotify's Autoplay Behavior on PC

 When you install the Spotify app on your Windows computer, it will automatically set itself as a startup app. It does this by default. However, if you don't want to see Spotify every time you turn on your computer, you can easily stop that from happening.

 Here we show you three simple ways to prevent Spotify from launching at startup on Windows.

## 1\. Stop Spotify From Opening Automatically by Changing Its Startup Behavior

 Spotify for Windows lets you customize its startup behavior directly from the in-app settings menu. You can modify the**Startup and window behavior** setting in the Spotify app to keep it from opening automatically on boot. Here are the steps you need to follow.

1. Click the magnifying icon on the taskbar or use the**Win + S** keyboard shortcut to open the search menu.
2. Type**Spotify** in the search box and select the first result that appears.
3. In the Spotify app, click the**three-dot menu icon** in the top left corner and select**Edit > Preferences** . Alternatively, you can use the**Ctrl + P** keyboard shortcut to directly open the Preferences menu in the Spotify app.
4. Scroll down to the**Startup and window behavior** section.
5. Click the drop-down menu to the right of **Open Spotify automatically after you log into the computer** and select**No** . If you want Spotify to run during startup but not launch full screen, select**Minimized** instead.

 After you complete the above steps, Spotify’s status should change to**Disabled** in the Task Manager app. Following that, the app will not open during startup. Later, if you want to re-enable Spotify as a startup app, you can change its status back to**Enabled** .

 Aside from managing startup apps, Task Manager is also useful for monitoring system resources, force-closing frozen apps, and doing other tasks.
