 Re-registering the Mail and Calendar app is another solution you can try in this situation. This method solves issues that lead to inaccessibility and sudden application crashes.

 Wait until the command is executed. After that, reboot the system, and check for the problem.

## 10\. Remove Corruption From Your Computer

 The problem can occur due to corrupt system files as well. You can eliminate the issue by running a System File Checker, aka SFC scan.

Here are the steps to run an SFC scan.

1. Open**Command Prompt** in Administrator mode by opening the**Start** menu, typing "command prompt,", right-clicking the search result, and selecting**Run as Administrator.**

`DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth`

Reboot the system once DISM finishes.
