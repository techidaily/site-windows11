## How to Download and Use Apple Calendar on Windows PC

 Apple Calendar helps you make the most of your schedules and reminders. On your Windows computer, you have two major ways to access and use Apple Calendar. Here’s how you can get started:

## 1\. Apple iCloud

[iCloud](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-icloud/) is an Apple service that keeps all your critical data on the cloud. It stores almost everything that's kept locally on your PC: Contacts, Pages, Reminders, etc.—it’s all there. You'll also find the Calendar app there, of course. So, if you want to access the Calendar app on Windows through iCloud, follow the steps below:

* Head to[iCloud.com](https://www.icloud.com/) and sign in to your Apple account.
* You'll get a sign-in confirmation on your Apple device. Click on**Allow** to go ahead with the sign-in.
* As soon as you click on**Allow** from above, you'll get a verification code. Note it down.
* Now head back to your Windows. You'll see a host of Apple apps here; click on**Calendar** .

 That’s it. Follow the above steps, and you’ll be inside the Calendar web app. You’ll get a view like this:

It includes everything from**Preferences** ,**New Event** ,**New Calendar** ,**Delete Event** ,**Go to Date** ,**Show Declined Events** , and so on. You can choose either of these, and you’ll be okay with the iCloud Calendar app.

* Enter the code you noted above into your iCloud app, and the app will log you in automatically.
* You’ll get asked to sync iCloud, Bookmarks, Photos, Mail, Calendar, etc.
* Turn on the**iCloud Mail** and**Calendar sync with Outlook** and click on**Apply** .
