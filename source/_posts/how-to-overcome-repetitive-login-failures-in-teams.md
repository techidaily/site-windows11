## How to Overcome Repetitive Login Failures in Teams

 Microsoft Teams is designed as one of the best messaging programs to help you and your team. However, it may run into the occasional glitch and keep asking you to sign in.

 If this has happened to you, here are a few troubleshooting tips to help you fix the issue.

## 1\. Update Microsoft Teams

 Microsoft constantly releases new app updates to add more features and fix any bugs. If you’re running an old Teams version, you should install any available updates to stop it from asking you to sign in.

 Launch the Microsoft Teams app and open the **three-dot** menu next to your profile icon. Then, head to **Settings** and click **About Teams**. Microsoft Teams will check for any available updates and install them if available.

 Alternatively, you can [update Windows apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-apps-windows-11/) through Microsoft Store.

## 2\. Use Microsoft Teams Online

 If updating the app didn’t stop Microsoft Teams from asking you to sign in, there’s an easy alternative for you. Use Microsoft Teams online.

 Go to the [Microsoft Teams website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software), and sign in using your credentials. This way, you’re not missing anything while you figure out how to fix the desktop app. You can even [join a Microsoft Teams meeting on your smartphone](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yvhUaGLFmNOyWhJyAvgfqhhiYAXMablw%5Fpcyf8%5F3MD4/edit).

## 3\. Clear the Microsoft Teams Cache

 Microsoft Teams stores cache to load faster and improve the overall user experience. While this may sound good, if the app collected too much cache or the cache somehow got corrupted, Teams will stop working properly.

 This might include [Microsoft Teams crashing](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-teams-keeps-crashing-windows/), taking a lot of your system resources, or repeatedly asking you to sign in. To fix it, you should delete the Microsoft Teams cache.

1. Press **Win + R** to bring up a Run dialog.
2. Type **%appdata%** and click **Ok**.
3. In the File Explorer window, head to **Microsoft > Teams**.
4. Select all folders and permanently delete them.

![Clear Microsoft Teams Cache in Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/clear-microsoft-teams-cache-in-windows.jpg)

 Restart Microsoft Teams and check if the issue is now solved. You may notice a decline in the app’s performance, but there’s no reason to worry. The app is now rebuilding its cache which shouldn’t take too long.

## 4\. Remove the App’s Credentials

 Windows Credential Manager is designed to make your life easier, as it stores your credentials for faster access. But if something's wrong with how it managers Teams credentials, you might run into the sign-in issue. In this case, you should remove the app's credentials.

1. Press **Windows key + R** to bring up a Run dialog.
2. Type **control /name Microsoft.CredentialManager** and press **Enter**.
3. In the Credential Manager window, select **Windows Credentials**.
4. From **Generic Credentials,** click the Microsoft Teams credentials.
5. Select **Remove**.

## 5\. Try Some Generic Fixes for Windows Apps
