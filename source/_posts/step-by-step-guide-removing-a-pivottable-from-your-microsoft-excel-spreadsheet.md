##  Use a Keyboard Key to Delete a PivotTable

 A quick way to remove a PivotTable from your spreadsheet is to use your keyboard's Delete key.

 To start, launch your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel. Then, in your spreadsheet, select the PivotTable you want to delete.

 While your table is selected, on your keyboard, press the Delete key.

 Excel shows no warning when you use the Delete key to remove a table, so make sure you're okay with losing your table's data.

 If you ever accidentally delete a table, you can restore it by quickly pressing Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Command+Z (Mac).
