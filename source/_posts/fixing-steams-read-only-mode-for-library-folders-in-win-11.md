## 7\. Run a Check Disk Scan

 Hard Disk errors can be a reason due to which Steam is unable to add or modify files.

5. Now, click on the **Add** button.

## 9\. Format the Disk and Try Again

 Many users want to install games on a newly added disk drive but face the “Steam library folder not writable” error in the process. It is mainly because the newly added disk drive bears the same letter as the old drive with a Steam Library folder.

1. Open the **Start** menu and type **create and format disk partitions**. Click on the **Open** option in the right pane.
2. Right-click on the new drive whose letter you want to change. Select the **Change Drive Letter and Paths** option.
3. Click on the **Change** button.
