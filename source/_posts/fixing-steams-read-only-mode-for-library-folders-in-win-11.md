## 8\. Reinstall the Game on Another Drive

 If you are unable to install the game on the C drive, you must add another drive in the Steam Storage settings. Then, attempt the game installation in the newly added drive. Here’s how to do it:

2. Click on the **Settings** option.
3. Scroll down and click on the **Storage** option.

5. Now, click on the **Add** button.

## 9\. Format the Disk and Try Again

 Many users want to install games on a newly added disk drive but face the “Steam library folder not writable” error in the process. It is mainly because the newly added disk drive bears the same letter as the old drive with a Steam Library folder.

 As such, you must assign a new driver letter and reformat the disk. Here’s how to do it:

1. Open the **Start** menu and type **create and format disk partitions**. Click on the **Open** option in the right pane.
2. Right-click on the new drive whose letter you want to change. Select the **Change Drive Letter and Paths** option.
3. Click on the **Change** button.
