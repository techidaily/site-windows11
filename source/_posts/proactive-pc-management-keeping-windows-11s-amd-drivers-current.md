 AMD is one of the leading chipset and graphic card manufacturers; AMD Radeon graphics are popular due to their incredible performance and reliability.

 It's essential you keep your Windows 11 AMD Radeon device updated with the latest display and graphics drivers to keep your machine performing optimally. But with so many official and third-party tools available online, it’s often confusing to figure out the best way to update your AMD Radeon device. Fortunately, we’re going to discuss reliable methods you can use to update your Windows 11 AMD Radeon PC safely.

 As with any driver, manufacturers always recommend[updating your drivers to the latest available version](https://www.makeuseof.com/computer-drivers-what-are-they-why-should-you-update/) for greater stability and performance. An outdated faulty graphic card driver can cause performance issues when gaming and streaming and even trigger a Blue Screen of Death.
