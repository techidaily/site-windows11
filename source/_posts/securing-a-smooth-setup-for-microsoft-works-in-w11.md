## Securing a Smooth Setup for Microsoft Works in W11

 Microsoft Works is a discontinued office suite the big M replaced with MS Office Stater in 2010\. Works was a cheaper alternative to Microsoft Office. That suite incorporated word processor, spreadsheet, and database applications with more limited features than MS Word, Excel, and Access.

 You can still utilize Microsoft Works 9 on a Windows 10 or 11 PC today. Although that suite might be a little dated, it’s freely available and comes with a good range of templates for document creation. This is how you can install and try out Microsoft Works on a Windows 11/10 PC.

## How to Download and Install Microsoft Works 9

 The Microsoft Works suite isn’t generally available on software download sites. However, you can still install and utilize that software with an MS Works ISO file preserved on the Internet Archives website.

 If you’re wondering [what an ISO is](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-iso/), it’s a file created from an optical disk. Thus, the Works ISO is from the disc with which users installed that suite. You can download and install Microsoft Works 9 with that ISO file as follows:

1. Open this [Internet Archives webpage](https://archive.org/details/microsoft-works-9) in your browser.
2. Click the **ISO IMAGE** download link.
