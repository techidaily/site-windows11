## 1\. Turn On Safe Search

 Considering the amount of inappropriate content on the internet, it might be necessary to put mechanisms in place to block out any adult content in your search, especially if you have little ones around.

 Turning safe search on will help you filter out explicit content, making it particularly suited for children. Usually, results from running a Windows search on your PC will include web previews relevant to your search. So, you can keep this feature turned on to exclude sensitive content from your search results.

 To turn Safe search on, head over to settings, either locating the settings app from**Start** or pressing the shortcut**Win + I** on your keyboard.

1. **Next, click Privacy & Security.**

2. Under**Windows permissions,** click**Search permissions** .  
![Screenshot of windows 11 privacy settings page](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-of-windows-11-privacy-settings-page.jpg)
3. This will open up SafeSearch settings, under which three options exist:**Strict** ,**Moderate,** and**Off** .

 The**Strict** setting will filter out all adult content in texts, images, and videos from web previews. On the other hand, the**Moderate** setting will only filter out adult images and videos, excluding text. Lastly, the**Off** option will disable the filter entirely from your web results.

 Choose any of the**SafeSearch** categories, depending on the level of filtering you want to apply to your search.

![Screenshot of cloud content search settings on windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-of-cloud-content-search-settings-on-windows-11.jpg)

## 3\. Clear Search History on Your Device

 Search history is stored by default on your device to help you get faster results and recommendations based on your search patterns.

 To change this, locate**History** from the**Search permissions** category and toggle off the first menu to prevent Windows from saving your device's search history.

![Screenshot of windows 11 Privacy & Security page (2)](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/screenshot-of-windows-11-privacy-security-page-2.jpg)

 Click**Clear device Search history** to delete search history on your device.

 You can also delete your cloud search history, as well as exclude web searches from your search suggestions.

 Results from the Windows search will often bring up previews of web results. If you find this a bit confusing, you can exclude web search results to streamline your search to only local results from your PC.

## 4\. Enable App Launch Tracking

 Enabling app launch tracking on your PC lets Windows monitor the apps you frequently use to improve your search results. Thus, you can access these apps easily, especially from the start menu.

 However, if you want to keep this turned off for, say, privacy concerns, Navigate to**Settings > Privacy & Security > General.** Then, toggle off **Let Windows improve start and search results by tracking app launches** .

## 5\. Utilize Enhanced Search

 When you run a search, your PC will typically look for files in specific locations, such as in the**Documents** or**Pictures** folders.

 The enhanced search extends the search to other parts of your PC, thereby improving the quality of your search results. This is done by[indexing the search results in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-index-faster-search-results/) , which means storing information on these files to make them easily accessible by your PC during a search.

 Usually, it is set to**Classic** by default on your PC; hence your search will be limited to certain prime locations on your computer. Turning on enhanced search will change this mode of operation.

 To turn on enhanced search, go to **Settings > Privacy & Security > Searching Windows to turn on enhanced search.** Tick the**Enhanced search** option to enable it. The process might take some time, so you might want to keep your PC plugged in.
