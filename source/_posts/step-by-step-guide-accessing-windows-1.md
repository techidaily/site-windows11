##  What Is the Group Policy Editor?

 Group Policy Editor is a utility that allows you to configure [Group Policy settings](https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-building-a-custom-link-for-youtubes-auto-subscribe/) for a Windows PC or a group of PCs. Aimed mostly at network administrators, Group Policy defines how you or a group of people can use your machines, restricting or allowing features as necessary.

![The Windows 10 Local Group Policy Editor Window](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/windows_10_group_policy_editor.jpg) 

 Group Policy Editor is a Microsoft Management Console app with the filename gpedit.msc, and it's usually located in the "C:\\Windows\\System32" folder.

 It's important to note that Group Policy Editor is _not_ available in Windows 10 or Windows 11 Home. It only ships with Windows 10 or Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise editions. If you're not sure [which edition of Windows you have](https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-breaking-boundaries-running-windows-and-mac-video-editing-software-on-chromebook-for-2024/), it's easy to find out. Open Settings, navigate to System > About, and you'll see it listed under Edition.

 There are several ways to open Group Policy Editor in Windows 10 and Windows 11, so we'll cover a handful of major ways to do it below. Each one will get you to the same place, so pick whichever suits you best.

##  Open the Group Policy Editor from the Start Menu

 Perhaps the easiest way to open the Group Policy Editor is by using search in the Start menu. First, click the Start button, and when it pops up, type **gpedit** and hit Enter when you see "Edit Group Policy" in the list of results.

 If you don't see "Edit group policy" in the Start menu results, you either entered a typo or you're running a Home edition of Windows 10 or Windows 11 which do not include the Group Policy Editor.

##  Open the Group Policy Editor from the "Run" Window

 You can also quickly launch the Group Policy Editor with a Run command. Press Windows+R on your keyboard to open the Run window, type **gpedit.msc**, and then hit Enter or click "OK."

![Press Windows+R, then type gpedit and click "OK."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gpedit-from-run-box.png) 

##  Open the Group Policy Editor from the Command Prompt

 If you like working from the command line, open up a [Windows Command Prompt](https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-tutorial-how-to-bypass-oppo-a78-frp-by-drfone-android/) and type **gpedit** or **gpedit.msc** on a blank line, and then hit Enter. The Group Policy Editor will open instantly.

##  Launch the Group Policy Editor from Settings

 You can also launch the Group Policy Editor from the Settings app. Press Windows+i to open Settings (or [launch the Settings app](https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/affordable-laptop-friendly-software-for-dvd-viewing/) however you normally might), then type **group policy** or **edit group policy** in the search bar in the upper-left corner. Click the "Edit Group Policy" result that appears.

##  Open the Group Policy Editor from Control Panel

 And finally, we have one of the slowest ways to open the Group Policy Editor: from Control Panel. To do so, [launch Control Panel](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-facetime-call-recording-securing-your-conversations/), and then click the search box in the upper-right corner of the window. Type **group policy**, and then click the "Edit Group Policy" link just below the "Administrative Tools" heading.
