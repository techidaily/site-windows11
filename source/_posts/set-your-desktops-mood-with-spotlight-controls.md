2. Select**Personalization** from the left pane.
3. Click on**Lock screen** .
4. Click the drop-down menu next to**Personalize your lock screen** and select**Windows spotlight** to enable the feature. If you want to disable spotlight images, select**Picture** or**Slideshow** instead.

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
2. Type**regedit** in the text box and press**Enter** to open the Registry Editor.
3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. Use the left pane to navigate to **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER > Software > Policies > Microsoft > Windows > CloudContent** .
5. Right-click on the**CloudContent** key and select**New > DWORD (32-bit) Value** . Rename the DWORD to**DisableWindowsSpotlightFeatures** .
6. Double-click on the newly created DWORD to edit it.
7. Enter**1** in the Value data field to disable spotlight images. If you want to enable them, enter**0** instead.

## Get a New View Every Day With Windows Spotlight

 As we just saw, you can enable or disable Windows spotlight images on the lock screen via the Settings app, Group Policy Editor, or Registry Editor. No matter which method you opt for, turning Windows spotlight images on or off should not take long.

 Since Windows stores all the spotlight images locally on your computer, you can even save them and use them as your desktop wallpaper if you want.
