 In any case, it’s fairly simple to enable or disable spotlight images on your Windows lock screen. Here's how you can go about it.

 The Settings app in Windows gives you several options for [customizing the lock screen](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-customize-lock-screen/) , including the ability to enable or disable spotlight images. It is also the quickest method for turning spotlight images on or off on Windows. Here are the steps you can follow.

1. Right-click on the**Start icon** and select**Settings** from the list.
2. Select**Personalization** from the left pane.
3. Click on**Lock screen** .
4. Click the drop-down menu next to**Personalize your lock screen** and select**Windows spotlight** to enable the feature. If you want to disable spotlight images, select**Picture** or**Slideshow** instead.

## 2\. How to Enable or Disable Windows Spotlight Images via the Group Policy Editor

 The Group Policy Editor is a useful tool for implementing system-level changes on Windows. If you have the Education, Enterprise, or Professional edition of Windows, you can enable or disable spotlight images on the lock screen via the Group Policy Editor. If you use Windows Home, however, check our guide on [how to access the Group Policy Editor in Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/) before proceeding.

 To enable or disable Windows spotlight images on your lock screen, use these steps:

## 3\. How to Enable or Disable Windows Spotlight Images With the Registry Editor

 Registry Editor in Windows provides yet another way to enable or disable spotlight images on the lock screen. However, this method may not be suitable for everyone, especially those who are not familiar with the Registry Editor.

 If you decide to use this method, make sure you [back up the Windows registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) or [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) before proceeding. Once you’ve done that, use the following steps to enable or disable spotlight images via the Registry Editor.

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog.
2. Type**regedit** in the text box and press**Enter** to open the Registry Editor.
3. Select**Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. Use the left pane to navigate to **HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER > Software > Policies > Microsoft > Windows > CloudContent** .
5. Right-click on the**CloudContent** key and select**New > DWORD (32-bit) Value** . Rename the DWORD to**DisableWindowsSpotlightFeatures** .
6. Double-click on the newly created DWORD to edit it.
7. Enter**1** in the Value data field to disable spotlight images. If you want to enable them, enter**0** instead.
8. Click**OK** .

## Get a New View Every Day With Windows Spotlight

 As we just saw, you can enable or disable Windows spotlight images on the lock screen via the Settings app, Group Policy Editor, or Registry Editor. No matter which method you opt for, turning Windows spotlight images on or off should not take long.

 Since Windows stores all the spotlight images locally on your computer, you can even save them and use them as your desktop wallpaper if you want.
