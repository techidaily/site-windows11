## Tick the Box: Quick Windows Fixes to Modify File Dates

 There are times when you might want to change the created/modified date for your files. For example, you could do this so that you can group your files by a certain common date.

 So, let’s check out some of the best apps that can help you change the created/modified date on Windows.
