4. If you leave the **Start in** field blank, the shortcut will work throughout the Windows environment. If you select a path here, the shortcut will only work when you are in that environment or program.
5. The **If running** field tells Windows how to handle the command if the program is already open and running. You can set this to one of several options: show the open window; open another instance of the program (if possible); close the program; do nothing; or end the entire program task.

 To remove a shortcut set up using PowerToys, simply open the utility, navigate to **Keyboard Manager**, select **Remap a shortcut**, and click on the delete button to the right of the specific shortcut you wish to remove.

 With Windows keyboard shortcuts set up, your work should be a lot more productive. Microsoft PowerToys can help you achieve this easily, but [there’s so much more you can do with this utility for power users](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-powertoys/), all in one place.
