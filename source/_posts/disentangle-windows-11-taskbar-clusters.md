## Disentangle Windows 11 Taskbar Clusters

 Microsoft first introduced icon grouping on the Windows taskbar in Windows 10\. Certain users dislike this functionality and want to change their taskbars to behave like the old tab system.

 What if you like the icons, but don't like how they group together? Let's have a look at how to disable taskbar icon grouping in Windows 11\.

## What Is Taskbar Icon Grouping?

 Icon grouping is when Windows 11 combines multiple windows of a single program together. For example, having multiple File Explorer windows open will show as one File Explorer icon with multiple tabs behind it.

 This results in a cleaner and less cluttered taskbar, but one that gives you significantly less information. Some users [restore the old taskbar labels on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-10-taskbar-labels/), but this takes up more space on your taskbar than the icons do.

## How to Disable Taskbar Icon Grouping
