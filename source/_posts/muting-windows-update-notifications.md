## Muting Windows Update Notifications

 Microsoft regularly releases patch updates to enhance your device's performance and security. When you download this update, Windows often replaces the usual Shut Down and Restart buttons with “Update and shut down” to remind you not to miss the update.

 However, you may sometimes encounter the same message prompting even after performing these actions. Read this guide to resolve this issue and stop getting such annoying notifications.

## 1\. Restart the Computer From Settings

 If restarting your computer with the power button does not work, do it via the Settings Menu. This trick has worked for many users who encountered the same issue. Try it and see if that helps.

1. [Open the Settings menu](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/).
2. Click **Windows Update** in the left sidebar.
3. Under Windows Update, you will find the **Restart now** option.
4. Select this option to restart your computer and install the pending updates.

## 2\. Install Pending Updates

 If your computer keeps reminding you to update and shuts down, check for pending updates. It is possible that the updates were not installed properly and Windows is now asking you to complete them.

 To check for pending updates, follow these steps.

1. Press **Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.
2. From the left sidebar, click on the **Windows Update** tab.
3. Select the **Check for updates** option from the right pane.

 This will search for available updates and install them if there are any. If you see no updates, continue to the next solution.

## 3\. Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter

 Windows operating system comes with troubleshooting tools specific to each problem. To solve update-related issues, use the Windows Update troubleshooter. This tool detects corrupted, or faulty files associated with updates and fixes them automatically.

 To run the Windows Update Troubleshooter, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on **Start** and select **Settings** from the menu list.
2. Select **Windows Update** in the left sidebar, then click **Troubleshoot**.
3. On the next page, click **Other trouble-shooters**.

4. Look for **Windows Update** and click **Run** next to it.  
![Run Windows Update Troubleshooter-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/run-windows-update-troubleshooter-1.jpg)

 Follow the instructions on the screen to let Windows Update Troubleshooter detect and fix problems. After running the troubleshooter, restart your computer and check if it solves the issue.

## 4\. Clear the Software Distribution Folder

 The Software Distribution folder contains downloaded updates and installation files. If these files become corrupted, it could lead to this issue. To fix it, clear the Software Distribution directory and check if that solves the problem.

1. Open the Start menu and type CMD in the search bar.
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** on your keyboard. This will open the Command Prompt as an administrator.
3. If a User Account Control window appears, click **Yes** to grant administrative privileges.
4. In the command prompt window, type the following commands in the order given and press Enter after each command:  
`net stop wuauserv  
net stop bits  
net stop cryptSvc  
net stop msiserver`
5. After that, open File Explorer and navigate to this path:  
`C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution`
6. In the SoftwareDistribution folder, select all the files and delete them permanently.  
![Clear SoftwareDistribution Folder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/clear-softwaredistribution-folder.jpg)
7. When a permissions pop-up appears, select the checkbox and click **Continue**.
8. After you delete the Software Distribution folder, you must restart the services you stopped. To do so, go back to the Command Prompt window and run the following command:  
`net start wuauserv  
net start bits  
net start cryptSvc  
net start msiserver`

 Now exit the Command Prompt window and restart your computer. After running these commands, check if the issue is solved.

 ​​​​

## 5\. Disable Windows Update

 If you keep encountering the issue, disable the Windows Update service. This will stop Windows from automatically downloading updates and showing the message.

 To disable Windows Update, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run command window.
2. Type **services.msc** in the dialog box and press Enter. This will open the Services console.
3. Search for **Windows Update**, right-click on it, and select **Stop**.

6. Click **Apply** \> **OK** to save the changes.
7. Now close the window and restart your computer.

 Sometimes you may not see the Restart option in the Start menu. In that case, [run the command prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/). Now type **shutdown -s -t 0** in the command prompt and hit Enter. This will restart your computer immediately.

 Here **0** is the time in seconds. If you want to delay the restart, use a higher number. For example, shutdown -s -t 10 will delay the restart by 10 seconds.

 ​​​​​After restarting, you should no longer see the “Update and Restart” or “Update and Shut Down” message.

## 6\. Reset the Windows Update Components

 If none of the solutions above work, reset Windows Update components. It deletes all the temporary download files and resets the registry keys containing information about Windows Update. This process also clears any corrupted files associated with updates and allows Windows to download the updates again.

 To reset the Windows Update components, follow these steps:

1. [Open the Notepad application](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-notepad/).
2. Copy the following commands and paste them into the Notepad window.  
`net stop bits
