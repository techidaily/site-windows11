## Top Strategies for Resolving Windows 11 OneDrive Disconnects

 With OneDrive pre-installed on Windows 11, you can seamlessly store your files online and access them. That is, of course, not possible if OneDrive runs into sync issues on your Windows 11 computer.

 If you are affected by a similar issue, don’t panic. We have compiled a list of several useful solutions that should get OneDrive to sync your files as before.

## 1\. Check the OneDrive Service Status

 Before trying anything else, you should check OneDrive's server status to make sure there's no widespread outage. You can visit [Microsoft’s service health page](https://portal.office.com/servicestatus) to check if OneDrive servers are up and running.

 If you see a red cross icon next to OneDrive, there may be nothing wrong on your end. You must wait until Microsoft resolves the issue on its end.

## 2\. Restart the OneDrive App

 This is another basic troubleshooting tip that can help resolve OneDrive sync issues on Windows 11\. Restarting the OneDrive app will take care of any temporary glitches the app may have encountered while running. If it’s nothing major, this should solve your problem.

 Follow these steps to restart the OneDrive app:

1. Click the **OneDrive icon** on the taskbar. If you can’t find it, click the **Show hidden icons** arrow.
2. Click the **gear icon** in the top right corner of the OneDrive window and select **Pause syncing** \> **Quit OneDrive**.
3. Select the **Close OneDrive** option when the confirmation prompt appears.
4. Open the **Start menu**, type in **OneDrive** and press **Enter**.

## 3\. Check Your Account Storage Status

 It is possible that your OneDrive account has run out of storage space, which is why your files are no longer syncing. OneDrive offers 5GB of storage for free, but you may have 100GB, 1TB, or 5TB if you have upgraded or have a [Microsoft 365 subscription](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-365-basic-tier-what-you-get/).

 Follow these steps to check the available storage space in your OneDrive account:

1. Click the **OneDrive icon** on the taskbar.
2. Click the **gear icon** and select **Settings**.
3. In the OneDrive Settings window that appears, check the storage status in the bottom left corner.

 If your OneDrive storage is nearly full, consider deleting some of your files or upgrading your plan.

## 4\. Verify Sync Settings

 Enabling battery saver mode or [using a metered connection on your Windows 11 computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-enable-or-disable-metered-connection-wi-fi-network-windows-11/) can cause Microsoft OneDrive to stop syncing. If you don’t want that, follow these steps to modify sync settings for OneDrive:

1. Click the **OneDrive icon** on the taskbar.
2. Click the **gear icon** and select **Settings**.
3. In the **Sync & backup** tab, turn off the toggles next to **Pause syncing when this device is in battery saver mode** and **Pause syncing when this device is on a metered network**.

## 5\. Make Sure Your Files Are Not Incompatible

 Although OneDrive allows you to sync nearly any file, there are specific restrictions and limitations regarding file types, names, sizes, and other factors. For instance, the maximum file size you can upload to OneDrive is 250GB. Microsoft periodically updates these restrictions and limitations to ensure smooth operation.

 So, if the OneDrive sync issue is limited to a select few files, refer to [Microsoft’s support page](http://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/restrictions-and-limitations-in-onedrive-and-sharepoint-64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa) for information on the restrictions and limitations that apply to OneDrive files.

## 6\. Remove OneDrive Upload and Download Rate Limit

 Is OneDrive taking longer than usual to sync files despite using a fast internet connection? If so, you may have set an upload or download rate limit for OneDrive. Follow these steps to remove this limit:

1. Click the **OneDrive icon** on the taskbar.
2. Click the **gear icon** and select **Settings**.
3. In the **Sync and backup** tab, click on **Advanced settings**.
4. Turn off the toggle for **Limit download rate** and **Limit upload rate**.

1. Open OneDrive settings.
2. Switch to the **About** tab and click the build number next to the **OneDrive version**.

1. Press **Win + S** to open the search menu.
2. Type **OneDrive** in the search box and select **Open file location**.
3. In the File Explorer window that opens, right-click on the **OneDrive** app shortcut, and select **Copy as path**.

## 10\. Try Basic Fixes

 If the above tips prove ineffective, you can try your luck with a few generic Windows fixes mentioned below.

* **Install Windows Updates:** OneDrive may be having sync issues due to a buggy Windows build. Try [installing any pending Windows updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-install-updates/) and see if that resolves the problem.
* **Disable Your Antivirus Program:** Third-party antivirus programs can sometimes conflict with OneDrive and cause problems. Try disabling your antivirus program temporarily to see if that helps.
* **Check Your Internet Connection:** This one may seem obvious, but a slow or intermittent internet connection can prevent OneDrive from syncing files. It’s a good idea to rule out any Ethernet or [Wi-Fi problems on your Windows 11 computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-wi-fi-problems/).
