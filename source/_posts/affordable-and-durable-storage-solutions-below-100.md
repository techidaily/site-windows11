## Affordable and Durable Storage Solutions Below $100

One of our favorite external SSDs is on sale, and this rugged storage device is worth every penny.

 It is always a good idea to invest in an external drive. You may have a cloud storage service to back up your most important files, but it's also worth utilizing a cold storage drive to physically keep them safe. For some, an external hard drive can sit on your desk and will be enough to store files, but if you need to take these files with you, you'll want an external solid state drive (SSD) that can handle the elements. You'll appreciate the extra speed, and with a rugged design, you won't lose everything if you accidentally drop it.

 So, which [external SSD](https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-engage-fans-through-real-time-streams-mobile-edition/) should you get? I'd recommend the [Samsung T7 Shield](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Photographers-Creators-MU-PE1T0S-AM/dp/B09VLK9W3S?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003889&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fget-rugged-reliable-storage-for-under-100%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate). [Our reviewer loved the drive](https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-subtitle-editing-on-mac-alternatives-to-subtitle-edit/) when he tested it:

 If you're in the market for an external and portable SSD, there is little reason to avoid the T7 Shield. It's rugged, water and dust resistant, has reliably fast read and write speeds, and can fit into any bag. The only reason to look at another option is if you're shopping on a budget.

 The only real knock he had against the T7 Shield was the price tag—which, at $169.99 for 1TB of sotrage, is a fair criticism. 

 That is why it's perfect to pick up on sale! The 1TB version of the Shield T7 is available for $99.99 for the [black](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VLK9W3S?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003889&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fget-rugged-reliable-storage-for-under-100%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) and [beige](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VLH13LX?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003889&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fget-rugged-reliable-storage-for-under-100%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) colorways, and even lower at $90.49 for the [blue colorway](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VLJB2DC?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003889&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fget-rugged-reliable-storage-for-under-100%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate). This is a fantastic deal if you need to keep a lot of files on you when you're out and about. So, this sort of SSD is great for photographers or people traveling a lot!
