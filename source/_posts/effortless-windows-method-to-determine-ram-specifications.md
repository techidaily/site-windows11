## 1\. How to Check the RAM Type With Command Prompt

 The most straightforward to check the RAM type on your Windows PC is via Command Prompt. You can use this method even [if you're a beginner with the Command Prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/), as it only requires you to run a single command.

 Here's how you can check the RAM type on Windows using the Command Prompt:

1. Right-click on the **Start icon** and select **Terminal (Admin)** from the menu that appears.
2. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
3. In the console, type the command mentioned below and press **Enter**.  
`wmic memorychip get devicelocator, memorytype`
4. Note down the code number under the **MemoryType** column.

## 3\. How to Check the RAM Type Using the Task Manager App

 Windows Task Manager can provide you with all the necessary hardware information you need about your PC, including the type of RAM installed. However, it's important to note that Task Manager does not show the memory type if your PC has [DDR4 or DDR5 RAM](https://www.makeuseof.com/ddr4-vs-ddr5-should-you-upgrade/). So, this method will only work for PCs with DDR3 or lower-generation RAM.

 To check the RAM type using Windows Task Manager, follow these steps:

1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to open the Task Manager.
2. Switch to the **Performance** tab.
3. Select **Memory** from the left pane. You should see the amount and type of RAM your PC has in the top right corner of the screen.

 The Windows Task Manager does more than show hardware information. You also use it to manage running programs, end tasks, and view resource usage.

## 4\. How to Check the RAM Type Using CPU-Z

 If you're seeking a relatively uncomplicated method to check the RAM type along with other hardware details, you can use a third-party app like CPU-Z.
