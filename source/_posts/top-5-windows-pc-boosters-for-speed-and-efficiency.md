## Top 5 Windows PC Boosters for Speed and Efficiency

 If you feel your Windows has been slow to respond lately, running a quick optimization can fix things. Even if it's working fine right now, clearing away your temporary files to optimize system settings or removing unnecessary programs, a handy optimization app will help you dial up your PC’s performance manifold.

 Moreover, due to its popularity, the Windows operating system supports a wide variety of tools that will help you get the job done with ease. So let’s look at the best PC optimizers for your Windows PC.

## 1\. CleanMyPC

![cleanmypc app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cleanmypc-app.jpg)

 CleanMyPC is a system optimizer that offers you the power of three different tools—[PC cleanup](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-way-clean-windows-10-step-step-guide/) , app uninstallation, and [Registry repair](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-fix-registry-errors/) —all in a single place.

 After you have installed and run the CleanMyPC, the app will scan through your whole PC to find (and then clean) all the junk files, leaving you with an instant performance boost.

 In addition, its registry repair and cleanup also helps you eliminate outdated or corrupt registries to keep your operating system functioning, making your PC as if it was a new machine brought straight from the market. In addition, there’s a slew of other related tools that can make things smoother for you, such as:

1. Tool to rack and remove unnecessary extensions or add-ons on your PC.
2. Protects your online privacy by clearing your browser cookies and other data.
3. Remove your hibernation files.
4. Manage startup programs to ensure a fast startup or free the memory they've occupied.
5. The app is available both in a free and paid version.

**Download:** [CleanMyPC](https://macpaw.audw.net/c/119570/66209/1733?subId1=UUmuoUeUpU2024813&subId2=emuo&u=https%3A%2F%2Fmacpaw.com%2Fcleanmypc) (Free, $39.95)

## 2\. AVG TuneUp

 Our second tool on this list is AVG TuneUp. The app works by removing all unnecessary clutter and performance issues from your PC, optimizes disk space, and [improves your PC’s speed](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/windows-10-faster-performance/) considerably.

 The tool packs a bunch of other tools that make it an apt choice for our best Windows optimizer list. We’ll list a few of them here:

* Supports clearing cookies and other data from over 20 browsers, including Firefox, Chrome, Opera, etc.
* Deep cleaner to rid your PC of installer files, old backups, temporary file systems, etc.
* Automatic app update feature for Windows.
* Feature to put programs that drain your background resources to sleep on their own.

 These and a few other features make AVG TuneUp a handy tool to keep in your arsenal. The only caveat is that there’s no free version available for the app. Instead, you can use the 7-day trial to gauge the tool's utility and then move on from there.

## 3\. CCleaner

![ccleaner app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ccleaner-app.jpg)

 A lot has been said and written about CCleaner over the years. At times, it’s been derided and called everything from untrustworthy to malware, best to be uninstalled yesterday. While at other times it has also been touted as one of the best optimization tools for Windows PC.

So, what's the current verdict?

 Although opinions can be as varied and fidgety as the people writing the reviews, hard empirical data is tough to ignore. So when you look at the numbers, it immediately becomes evident that CCleaner does what it says on the tin, having constantly been picked by users for their PC's optimization needs, and is one of the most downloaded user optimization tools on a Windows PC.

 After you've installed the tool and launched it, you will find the**PC Health Check** right on the main menu. It’s a feature that will run a scan and cover four different areas of your PC, which are:

1. Speed
2. Security
3. Privacy
4. Space

 All you have to do from there, then, is to click on**Scan PC** from the main screen, and the device will start scanning your Windows.

 And then there’s**Custom Clean** , a feature that lets you customize how you clean up different parts of your Windows PC, covering everything from Microsoft apps to additional applications.

 Again, the CCleaner also comes in both free and premium versions. While the free version cleans your Windows just as well, the paid version offers additional features such as Real-time Monitoring, Privacy Protection, Software Updater, Scheduled Cleaning, etc.

**Download:** [CCleaner](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7251228/type/dlg/sid/UUmuoUeUpU2024813/https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner/download) (Free, $29.95)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Restoro

![restoro](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/restoro.jpg)

 Restoro makes it to number four on our best Windows PC optimization tools. The app is an all-in-one tool to help you fix your Windows issues, offering handy features like repairing your corrupt registers, restoring corrupt system files, removing malware, and recovering corrupt DLL files.

 The app is available as a trial for new users who might first prefer to dip their toes in instead of going all in at once, and a premium version for new or experienced users alike.

 When you launch Restoro the first time after your installation, the app will automatically begin scanning your PC for any faults. You will see something like this:

 The scan can take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour, depending on the existing files on your PC.

**Download:** [Restoro](http://www.restoro.com) [RestoroRestoro](https://www.restoro.com/) [Restoro](https://www.restoro.com/) [Restoro](https://www.restoro.com/) (Free, $32.50)

## 5\. IOBit Advance SystemCare

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://propmoneyinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/1803116/14559" target="_top" id="1803116"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14559-1803116" border="0" alt="" width="859" height="859"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1803116/14559" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![advanced systemcare](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/advanced-systemcare.jpg)

 Advance System Care from IOBit is another all-in-one tool that can clean, speed up and protect your Windows PC—all within a few minutes. Apart from the simple cleaning or clearing features described above, here are other features that make this app a good pick for Windows users:

* Allows you to update different drivers on your Windows PC, all with a single click.
* Comes with over thirty different troubleshooters to help you fix your slow PC.
* Clamp up against your privacy vulnerabilities with updated security tools like WebGL or Audio Fingerprint Protections.
* Real-time system performance review to keep a check and release relevant information as necessary.

 Moreover, although the tool claims to have an AI-backed cleanup system, like most things related to AI in the tech industry for now, there doesn’t seem to be an actual application of any intelligence—or even any black box algorithms—behind the scenes.

 The tool is available for Windows 10 and 11 and offers free and paid versions.
