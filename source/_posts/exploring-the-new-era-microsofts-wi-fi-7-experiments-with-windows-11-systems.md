## Exploring the New Era: Microsoft's Wi-Fi 7 Experiments with Windows 11 Systems

Microsoft is now [testing Wi-Fi 7 support](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/02/22/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26063-canary-channel/) in Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26063\. This release is limited to the Canary Channel, though a rollout for Dev Channel users may occur within the next few weeks.

 Modern Wi-Fi standards are a bit confusing. We've spent the last decade using Wi-Fi 5, but hardware manufacturers and ISPs are now pushing for a transition to [Wi-Fi 6](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-spotify-location-after-moving-to-another-country-on-vivo-s17-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) and [Wi-Fi 6E](https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/024-approved-the-top-20-gags-and-laughter-on-youtube-for-downtime-delight/). These next-gen connectivity standards deliver speeds up to 9.6Gbps, a nearly threefold increase from Wi-Fi 5's maximum speed. The Wi-Fi 6E platform also utilizes the 6GHz band—a new "lane" for internet traffic that reduces network congestion.

 The average home internet speed in the United States is [only about 224Mbps](https://www.allconnect.com/blog/us-internet-speeds-globally). So, very few homes can take full advantage of Wi-Fi 6 or 6E. But some high-end laptops and smartphones now boast [Wi-Fi 7](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/024-approved-vogue-videos-compiling-free-youtube-channel-frames/) connectivity, which provides a maximum theoretical throughput of over 40Gbps. Real-world performance will vary, and most Wi-Fi 7 routers only advertise 19Gbps wireless speeds, though it's clear that Wi-Fi 7 is completely overkill for the average person in 2024.

 However, there are already Wi-Fi 7 products on the market. And some of these products are Windows 11 laptops. Microsoft has a responsibility to serve the businesses and individuals that demand Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, so it's testing Wi-Fi 7 in Windows 11.

 A similar rollout for Windows 10 seems unlikely. We've heard several rumors of Wi-Fi 7 in Windows 10—some positive, some negative. But manufacturers aren't shipping Windows 10 laptops with Wi-Fi 7 cards, and Wi-Fi 7 routers will still be relatively uncommon when Windows 10 reaches end-of-life in [October 2025](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/elite-monitors-elevate-photo-editing-find-the-best/). If Microsoft decides to extend this blessing to Windows 10, it will benefit a minuscule portion of the PC user base.

 Just to reiterate, you can only test Wi-Fi 7 connectivity in Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26063\. This build is exclusive to the Canary Channel, as Microsoft is currently using the Dev Channel to prepare its servicing pipeline for the Windows 11 24H2 annual feature update. Mainline Windows 11 users will receive Wi-Fi 7 support later this year.
