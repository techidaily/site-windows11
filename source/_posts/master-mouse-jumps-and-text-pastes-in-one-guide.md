## Master Mouse Jumps & Text Pastes in One Guide

 Microsoft PowerToys is an absolute delight for users seeking to get more out of their Windows computers. Despite revamping the design with Windows 11, there are many features that are still missing in the new version. But with PowerToys, you can pin windows on top, apply system-wide accent color and do much more.

 PowerToys recently added two new features: Paste as Plain Text and Mouse Jump. We will discuss the usefulness of these features along with the steps to apply and use them on your system. Without further ado, let’s dive into the post.

## What Is the "Paste as Plain Text" Feature in PowerToys?

 Whenever you copy text from a site or a document that contains styling, everything gets copied to the clipboard. If you paste that directly into a Word document or any[free online text editor](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-more-fresh-free-online-word-processors/) , it retains all the source formatting. Somethings this is great; other times, it messes up your document's formatting.

 You can use**Ctrl + Shift + V** as a workaround to paste as plain text, but that doesn’t work with applications like Microsoft Word. So, it is not a permanent solution to remove source formatting from the text.

 If your version of PowerToys is up-to-date, you get the Paste as Plain Text feature which works like a charm. You can even paste text in Microsoft Word and other applications that don’t play nicely with the default**Ctrl + Shift + V** shortcut. The application even allows you to set a custom keyboard shortcut: so you don’t need to press a longer and more difficult three-key combination.

## How to Enable and Use the "Paste as Plain Text" Feature in PowerToys

 This feature is available in the PowerToys version 0.68.0\. So, make sure to update the application to the latest version from Microsoft Store or[download PowerToys from GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases) . Repeat the following steps to enable and customize the feature:

1. Launch PowerToys on your system. Go to the left-hand side menu and click on the**Paste as Plain Text** option.
2. Click on the**toggle** next to the**Enable Paste As Plain Text** option to enable the feature.
3. Next, you need to configure the shortcut key to paste as plain text. The default key combination is too long, so you must change it.
4. Click on the**pencil** icon. Press the keys you want to set as a shortcut for Paste as Plain Text feature. Then click on the**Save** button.

5. Minimize the PowerToys window and then copy any text with some formatting associated with it.

## What Is "Mouse Jump" in PowerToys?

 Mouse Jump aims to fix a fatal flaw while using a widescreen multiple display setup. The screen is so wide that it becomes impossible for the user to drag the mouse across the screen without lifting it once or twice. Laptop users have to suffer even more due to the small size of the trackpad.

 You can fix these annoyances with a[dual-monitor management app for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/software-manage-dual-monitors/) , but Mike Clayton already had a tool called[FancyMouse on GitHub](https://github.com/mikeclayton/FancyMouse) . But now he merged the tool with PowerToys which is great news for all power users.

 With the Mouse Jump feature, you can press a shortcut key to open a small replica of the complete display and then move the mouse cursor to the desired location. It saves a lot of time wasted in struggling to get from one corner to other on a wide-screen display.
