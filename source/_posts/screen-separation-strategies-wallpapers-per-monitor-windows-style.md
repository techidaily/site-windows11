## How to Use Separate Wallpapers on Different Monitors in Windows 11

 Windows 11 offers a handful of pre-installed wallpapers to set as your desktop background. If you prefer a custom background, you can use a saved picture or [download high-resolution wallpapers from the internet](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-sites-to-download-very-high-resolution-wallpapers/) and set different wallpaper for each monitor.

 To customize which wallpapers appear on which monitor:

1. Press **Win + I** to open **Settings**.
2. Open the **Personalization** tab, then click **Background** in the right pane.
3. Make sure the **Personalize your background** dropdown is set to **Picture**.

4. Click **Browse photos** and choose the image you want to set as a desktop background. Repeat the steps to add more photos.
