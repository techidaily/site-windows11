 Sometimes you want your Excel spreadsheet to have a good appearance in addition to displaying the data. Rather than [wrapping text](https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-apex-thrill-racers-our-favorites-5/) in a cell or [adjusting a cell's size](https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-ultimate-routine-personalize-your-youtube-shorts-image-credits/) to accommodate the text, you can shrink the text to fit.

 Let's look at the advantages of using the shrink text feature and how to use it in Microsoft Excel on Windows and Mac.

##  Benefits of Shrinking Text in Excel

 Here are a few reasons to use Excel's shrink text feature.

* You can save time by avoiding trying different font sizes to get the text to fit inside the cell.
* If you [change the font size](https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-an-elite-home-computer-for-professional-4k-editing/) or style in your sheet or for selected cells, those cells you apply the shrink to retain the smaller size to fit the cells.
* You can keep your cells and [columns the size you want](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-your-realme-11-5g-phone-with-ease-the-3-best-lock-screen-removal-tools-by-drfone-android/) without sacrificing appearance by making them larger to fit the text.
* If you adjust the cell size after you shrink the text, that text will adjust its size to fit the cell.
