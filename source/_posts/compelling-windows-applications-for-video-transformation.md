 Converting videos with AVC is easy. Drag and drop the video you want to convert to the timeline. You can then choose a video format based on file formats or devices. For example, you can select Apple, Android, Windows, and mobile platforms to convert the video to a compatible format.

 You can further configure the video and audio properties in the advanced section. You can choose from different video and audio encoders, bitrate, frame per second, channels, and filling methods.

## 2\. VideoProc Converter

![VIdeoProc Converter Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/videoproc-converter-windows.jpg)

 If you don't have the impetus to learn all the complexity of a video editor, VideoProc Converter is a good choice. It is a premium converter utility with a limited set of features necessary to convert and make minor modifications to the video.

 You can drag and drop the video into the timeline and start editing. The quick editing menu lets you add video effects, watermark, cut, rotate, crop, and add subtitles to the video.

## 3\. Freemake Video Converter

![freemake video converter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/freemake-video-converter.jpg)

 Freemake Video Converter is a popular video converter with over 103 million downloads, available for Windows. With its well-designed user interface, you can use it to convert one or multiple files, but there is a caveat.

 A common feature across video converters are presets, and Freemake Video Converter is no different. Presets are built-in output profiles that let you convert videos for different devices and file formats. You can use the built-in output profiles to convert videos to different formats or devices, including Android, Apple, gaming consoles, and web players. If the presets don't work, you can create custom output settings.

 The app is easy to use, with all the features to convert your videos on the timeline. You can add audio and subtitles to the video if missing, but the features list ends just there.

 While the processing and conversion happen quickly, a big caveat is the Freemake watermark. On the free version, you'll find the converters pasting their watermark in the beginning and all over the video, which is unpleasant, to say the least. You can, however, subscribe to its monthly subscription starting at $39.95 per month or a lifetime version at $59.95 to remove the watermark. A purchase will also unlock more premium features, including full HD support, better conversion speed, more presets, and a subtitles editor.

 If you consider a purchase, look out for discount pop-ups when using the app to get better lifetime deals.

## 4\. Free HD Video Converter

## 6\. WinX HD Video Converter

 WinX HD Video Converter is similar to other video converters in this article. It is a premium utility with a limited free trial and an easy-to-use interface.

 When you add a video, you'll be asked to select an output profile. You can choose from recent users, general profiles, audio formats, or device profiles. It can play and convert 4K videos, but you can customize the resolution to reduce the video size to a lower resolution.

## Convert Your Videos to Multiple Formats on Windows

 Video Converters are a handy utility to convert video files to multiple file formats, including MP4, AVI, MKV, and more, in different resolutions to reduce size. Some also come with additional tools to create animated GIFs, add watermarks, and basic editing to trim, rotate and resize the video.

 That said, if you want to perform occasional video conversions, consider using an online video converter. While not as feature-rich as offline converters, they allow you to save on system resources and don't take permanent space on your storage drive.

 Windows has plenty of video converters to choose from. While some are free, others offer premium features catered to professional users. In this guide, we have jotted down a list of the best video converts for your Windows PC to convert any video to your preferred format.
