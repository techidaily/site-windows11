## Windows 11 Shortcut for Character Viewing

 If you're working with text, sooner or later you will need to use special characters. On Windows, there's a tool called Character Map that lets you view and use all the characters available in the installed fonts. With this tool, you can create documents or website designs that require symbols or characters not found on a standard keyboard.

 If you would like to access all of these characters, you will need to open up the Character Map application. Here is how to do that in Windows 11.

## 1\. How to Open Character Map Using Windows Search

 If you need to use special characters in your documents, the Character Map tool can help. This tool is built into Windows and can be opened using the Windows Search tool. Here's how to open it.

1. Press**Win + Q** on your keyboard to open the Windows Search box.

2. Type "character map" in the search box and hit the**Enter** key.

 Once you've opened Character Map, you can select a font from the drop-down menu at the top of the window. Then, scroll through the list of available characters and click on the one you want to insert. Finally, click the Copy button and paste the character into your document or email.

## 2\. How to Open Character Map Using the Run Dialog

 The Run command dialog is another way to quickly find the apps and programs you are looking for. In order to open the Character Map using the Run dialog box, follow these steps:

2. Type "charmap" into the text box and press the**Enter** key. The Character Map window will now appear on your screen.

## 3\. How to Open Character Map From the Start Menu

 If you're a Windows user, it is very likely that you have heard of the Character Map application. Although the program is hidden in a folder that is not easily accessible, the Start menu will help you find it. This is how you do it:

1. Open the Start button.

1. Click on the**Start** button and search for "Control Panel."
2. Select the result at the top of the list.
3. In Control Panel, click the View by drop-down menu and choose "Large icons" or "Small icons".

## 8\. How to Open Character Map Via Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell

 If you prefer a command-line interface, you can open the Character Map tool with PowerShell or Command Prompt. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Run Command Prompt as an administrator (see [how to open the Command Prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) for instructions).
2. Type "charmap" in the Command Prompt or PowerShell window.

3. Now press the**Enter** key. The Character Map application will appear on your screen.

## 9\. Pin the Command Prompt to the Start menu or Taskbar

 Furthermore, you can also pin the Character Map application to the taskbar for easy access. Follow these steps to take so:

1. Click on Start and type "Character Map."
2. Under Character Map, select**Pin to taskbar** on the right side.
