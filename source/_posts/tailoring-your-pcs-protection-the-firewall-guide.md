## Tailoring Your PC's Protection: The Firewall Guide

 The Windows Firewall protects your device from malicious threats. But if you don't configure its settings correctly, this tool might prevent you from accessing most of the apps on your device.

 So, what's the solution if you've configured the wrong firewall settings by mistake? It's simple—all you need to do is reset these settings to their defaults.

 Let’s dive in and explore all the solutions.

## 1\. Use the Control Panel

 The Control Panel is an incredible tool that allows you to troubleshoot system issues or tweak PC settings. Now, let’s check out how this tool can help you reset the firewall settings:

1. Type **Control Panel** in the Start menu search bar and select the **Best match**. Alternatively, check out [the various way to access the Control Panel](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-control-panel/).
2. Click the **View by** drop-down menu and select either the **Small icons** or **Large icons** option.
3. Select **Windows Defender Firewall** from the menu items.
4. Click the **Restore defaults** option on the left-hand side and follow the on-screen instructions.

## 2\. Use the Command Prompt

 Ever used the Command Prompt before? It’s an incredible tool that helps you configure system settings, troubleshoot PC issues, and access various apps.

 In fact, you can perform a lot of tasks with this tool as long as you [type in the correct commands](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/15-cmd-commands-every-windows-user-know/).

 Now, let’s check out how to reset the firewall settings using the Command Prompt:

1. Type **Command Prompt** in the Start menu search bar.
2. Right-click on the **Best match** result and select **Run as administrator**.
3. Type the following command and press **Enter**:

 Wait for the process to complete. From there, restart your device to save these changes.

## 3\. Use Windows PowerShell

2. Right-click on the **Best match** result and select **Run as Administrator**.
3. Copy-paste the following command into PowerShell and press **Enter**:

(New-Object -ComObject HNetCfg.FwPolicy2).RestoreLocalFirewallDefaults()

 Wait for the process to complete, and then restart your device.

## 4\. Use the Windows Security App

 Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Press **Win + I** to access the system settings.
2. Select the **Update & Security** option.
3. Click the **Windows Security** option on the left-hand side.

## 5\. Use the "Firewall with Advanced Security" Tool

 Still can’t reset the firewall settings? Try one of the options in the “Windows Firewall with Advanced Security” screen.

 As the name suggests, the “Windows Firewall with Advanced Security” tool allows you to configure various advanced settings. So, you can use it later if you want to tweak various firewall settings.

 For now, let’s check out how this tool can help you reset the firewall settings:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the Run command dialog box.
2. Type **wf.msc** and press **Enter** to open the “Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security” screen.
