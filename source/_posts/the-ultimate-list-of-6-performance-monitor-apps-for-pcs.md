 ManicTime is a powerful assistant that gives you a clear idea of your computer usage habits. You can track and measure apps, files, and internet URLs within a set time frame.

 The Timeline view provides a color-coded graph of how long different apps have been used. You can easily zoom in and out or highlight a specific region of the day by dragging your cursor. Above the timeline, you can also see a record of active and inactive computer usage which can help you [limit screen time](https://www.makeuseof.com/limit-screen-time-without-screen/).

 ManicTime features some of the most accurate tools to help you understand your computer usage. The left sidebar displays a list of time entries (recorded automatically.) Beside each entry, you’ll see a start and end time and a duration. You can use the **Filter** option to highlight a specific app and view its total duration. You’ll also find duration values on the right sidebar alongside a percentage of its usage.

 ManicTime does a brilliant job of tracking your computer usage, and you can access all the essential features in the free version.

 To help ActivityWatch assign apps to different categories, you can set up rules in the app’s Category Builder. There are two pages to view your PC usage: the **Timeline** tab and the **Activity** tab. The timeline option provides the most basic view. You can adjust the time range and rename entries by clicking on them.

 If you’re looking for a more detailed analysis, head to the **Activity** tab. This offers a range of statistics, including a display of your top apps and categories, and a category tree. Most impressively, you can create a custom view of statistics. From this window, you can add multiple graphs and reorder them to your liking.

You can use this to [avoid distractions when working from home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/focus-work-home-avoid-distractions/).

 If you’re using RescueTime for work purposes, you can add offline work, such as meetings or interviews. For working remotely, you can start a focus session to help you focus on only what’s necessary.

You can view your usage in two formats: a list or a timeline view. You can also add time entries manually. For super-detailed analysis, you can view time spent on individual tabs, which is far more useful than seeing one entry labeled “Internet.”

 If you’re using Timely solely for work, you can train Timely’s AI to recognize what types of activities to ignore. It can also generate timesheets and provide time management suggestions. Timely also offers a bunch of other time management tools, such as a timer and a scheduling tool.
