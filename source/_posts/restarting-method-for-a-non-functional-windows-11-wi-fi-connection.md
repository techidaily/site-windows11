## Restarting Method for a Non-Functional Windows 11 Wi-Fi Connection

 A mobile hotspot is a great way to keep your devices connected while you are on the go or when other connections are not available to you. It provides reliable and secure connections to the internet. Although, as with any technology, there can sometimes be issues and you may encounter connectivity problems.

 If you're having trouble getting your Windows device to connect via a mobile hotspot, don't worry - this guide will help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

## What Causes My Mobile Hotspot to Stop Working?

 If you find that your mobile hotspot is not working, it could be due to a number of reasons. The most common cause of a non-functioning mobile hotspot is an outdated network adapter driver.

 If the network adapter driver does not have the latest updates, the connection may become unstable or even disconnect unexpectedly. To ensure that your mobile hotspot functions correctly, make sure that all drivers are updated regularly.

## 1\. Troubleshoot Network Adapter

 If you are having mobile hotspot problems in Windows 11, the first step should always be to run the Network Adapter Troubleshooter. This built-in utility can easily identify and resolve a variety of network connection issues that may be causing your mobile hotspot not to work properly.

To access this tool, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.
2. From there, navigate to**System > Troubleshoot > Other troubleshooters** .
3. On the next page, scroll down to**Network Adapter** .
4. Finally, click the**Run** button to begin the process.  
![Run Network Adapter troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/run-network-adapter-troubleshooter.jpg)

 The troubleshooter will scan for any potential issues and then provide some advice on how to resolve them. It may even automatically fix some of these problems if possible, which could potentially save you time over manually trying to diagnose them yourself.

## 2\. Update Your Network Adapter

 When running the Network Adapter Troubleshooter does not resolve the issue, you should then check your Wi-Fi driver. If it's out of date, updating it may solve the problem. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on Start and select**Device Manager** .
2. In Device Manager, expand**Network adapters** .
3. Right-click on your Wi-Fi driver and choose**Update driver** .  
![Update Wi-Fi driver](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/update-wi-fi-driver.jpg)
4. On the next screen, select**Search automatically for drivers** .

 After that, wait for the process to finish then restart your computer.

 Sometimes, Device Manager has some issues finding the most recent drivers. If Windows finds nothing and you want a second opinion, check out the[best driver updaters for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-best-free-driver-updaters/) for some other tools you can try.

## 3\. Modify the Adapter Settings

 Another tactic is to configure the settings of your wireless adapter to ensure that it is working optimally with your mobile hotspot. Here's how to do this:

1. Right-click on Start and select**Settings** . You can also press**Win + I** on your keyboard to open the tool directly.
2. Click**Network & internet** on the left panel of Settings.
3. On the right, select**Advanced network settings** .
4. Under Related settings, click**More network adapter options** . This will open the classic Network Connections window.  
![More network adapter options in Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/more-network-adapter-options-in-settings.jpg)
5. Right-click your Wi-Fi adapter and select**Properties** from the context menu
6. In the Properties window, switch to the**Sharing** tab.
7. Then check the box next to **Allow other network users to connect through this computer’s Internet connection** .  
![Modify the Adapter Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/modify-the-adapter-settings.jpg)
8. Click**OK** to save the changes.

 After performing the above steps, see whether you can now use the hotspot feature on your Windows device.

## 4\. Tweak Registry Editor

 If you're still having problems connecting to your Windows mobile hotspot, it's likely that some changes need to be made to the registry on your computer.

 The Registry Editor contains information about user settings, hardware configurations, software programs, file types, as well as other critical parts of the Windows operating system. Making a tweak to your registry can help fix this issue with the mobile hotspot.

To get started, go through these steps:

1. Press**Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run dialog box. You can also use one of the other[ways to open Run on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-run-command-dialog-box/) .
2. Type "regedit" into the text box and hit Enter.
3. In the Registry Editor, go to the following location.  
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WlanSvc\Parameters\HostedNetworkSettings\
4. On the right pane, right-click**HostedNetworkSettings** and select**Delete** .  
![Delete HostedNetworkSettings in Registry](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/delete-hostednetworksettings-in-registry.jpg)
5. The confirmation window will appear on the screen. Click**Yes** to continue.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 The next thing you need to do is restart your computer and then try using your mobile hotspot again.

## 5\. Reset Network Settings

1. Open System Settings (see[how to open System Settings on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) for more information).
2. From the left pane, select the**Network & internet** tab.

4. Under the**More settings** section, click on**Network reset** .  
![Network reset in Windows Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/network-reset-in-windows-settings.jpg)
5. Next, click**Reset now** next to Network reset.
6. Click**Yes** in the confirmation window when it appears.  
![Reset Network Settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/reset-network-settings.jpg)

## 6\. Troubleshoot the Problem in a Clean Boot State

2. Type "msconfig" in the dialog box, then press Enter.
3. In the System Configuration window, click the**General** tab.
