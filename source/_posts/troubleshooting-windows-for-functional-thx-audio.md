## Troubleshooting Windows for Functional THX Audio

 THX Spatial Audio is an audio enhancement and tuning utility available as a premium purchase for all Windows devices. However, the audio enhancer can run into issues and stop working, leaving you with no sound.

 If you experience no sound from THX Spatial Audio, it can be due to an incorrectly configured default playback device or incompatibility issues. Here are a few troubleshooting steps to help you fix this problem and get THX Spatial Audio working again.

## 1\. Run the Windows Audio Troubleshooter

 The Windows Audio troubleshooter can find and fix common audio issues with the system's sound and audio devices. For instance, it should be one of your first ports of call if you want to[fix no audio on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-no-audio-windows-11/) .

 The troubleshooter will scan the system for issues and then recommend fixes accordingly.

To run the Windows Audio troubleshooter:

1. Press**Win + I** to open**Windows Settings.**
2. In the**System** tab, scroll down and click on**Troubleshoot** .  
![Windows 11 settings troubleshoot](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/windows-11-settings-troubleshoot.jpg)

6. Follow on-screen instructions and apply the recommended fixes.

 Fortunately, you can easily[switch between audio output devices in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-change-sound-output-device/) . Follow these steps to check and set THX Spatial Audio as your default audio output device.
