## Navigate and Implement Windows 11 Family Safety Options

 If you're worried that your kids spend too much time playing games or that they might visit websites with inappropriate content, you should use Parental control. To set it up, you only need a Microsoft account and the best part is that you can add multiple devices, including gaming consoles.

 With that said, let's see how you can keep your peace of mind with Microsoft's Parental control feature.

## How to Create an Account for Your Child on Windows 11

 The first step of setting up parental control in Windows 11 is to create a child account. If you haven’t done it already, here’s how you can do it:

1. Launch Windows Settings.
2. Go to**Accounts > Family & other users** .
3. There, click**Add account** next to**Add a family member** .
4. In the pop-up window, click**Create one for a child** .
5. Enter the email and password for the new account.

 Since you will not use this account too often, you should learn[how to start using a password manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-start-using-password-manager/) to remember its credentials.

## How to Set Up Windows 11's Parental Control Feature

 With the new account created, you can now control its access to certain websites, apps, and limit screen time.

 Press**Win + I** to launch Settings and click**Accounts > Family & other users** . There, click**Manage family settings online or remove an account** .

![Parental control settings in Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/parental-control-1.jpg)

 This will bring up the Microsoft Family Safety website. Click the**Sign in to Family Safety** and enter your Microsoft account credentials. There you’ll see every account connected to your Microsoft account, including your child’s account.

 To manage your child’s account, you’ll have to connect it to a device. If you want to connect it to your computer, sign in using its credentials.

 Now, head back to the Family Safety webpage as shown before, and click your child’s account. In the left pane, you can see the categories for setting and changing permissions.

## How to Monitor and Change Permissions in Parental Control

 In the**Overview** tab, you can check general information about your child’s account, such as spent screen time, which games your child is playing, or the amount of spent money.

### How to Use Parental Control to Limit Screen Time

 If you want to reduce the amount of time your kids are spending in front of a screen, you can set a daily schedule.

 In the left pane, click**Screen time** .

 You can decide how much time your kid can spend using an individual device, or you can set the same schedule for every device they’re connected to. To change how much screen time they’re allowed, click on one of the days.

### How to Use Parental Control to Filter Content

 Also, you can block certain websites, if you think they might be inappropriate for your child.

 The filters and activity reporting work only if your kid is using Microsoft Edge. However, you can add the other internet browsers to the list of blocked apps in the**Overview** menu, or you can[use a parental control app for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-parental-control-apps-windows/) .
