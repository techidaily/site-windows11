## Master Syncing: How to Rectify Non-Syncing In MS To Do

 Is the Microsoft To Do app not syncing? There could be several reasons behind this issue. Maybe youâ€™re running an outdated app version, youâ€™ve encountered an app bug or glitch, or thereâ€™s an authenticating issue, among other possible causes.

 Either way, you shouldnâ€™t let Microsoft To Do syncing issues affect your productivity. Here's how to fix it.

## 1\. Check the Microsoft To Do Server Status

 Thereâ€™s a chance thereâ€™s nothing wrong with the app, but Microsoft is doing some maintenance or troubleshooting work on its servers. Which is why Microsoft To Do isnâ€™t syncing.

 You can check the serversâ€™ status by heading to the [Microsoft Service Status webpage](https://admin.microsoft.com/servicestatus). If thereâ€™s an issue with Microsoft To Do, youâ€™ll have to wait until they fix it.

![Check Microsoft To Do status on Microsoft website](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/microsoft-to-do-status-1.jpg)

 Also, [check the internet connection on your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-stability-internet-connection-windows/) as an unstable connection will stop Microsoft To Do from syncing.

## 2\. Restart the App

 Whenever youâ€™re dealing with a problematic app, the first thing you should do is restart it. The issue might be a temporary glitch or a malfunctioning process that stops Microsoft To Do from syncing.

 Close Microsoft To Do and press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to bring up the Task Manager. There, right-click the app and select **End task**. This way, you stop any background process from running, and youâ€™ll have a fresh start when you relaunch the app.

## 3\. Update Microsoft To Do

 If restarting the app didnâ€™t fix the syncing issue, you should check if youâ€™re running the latest version available. If Microsoft To Do fails to update itself, you can manually update the app.

 On a Windows computer, open the Microsoft Store and check if thereâ€™s an update available for Microsoft To Do. You can also click the **Get updates** button to download and install all pending updates for your apps.

## 5\. Let the App Run in the Background

 On Windows, apps can keep running their processes even if youâ€™re not actively in the appâ€™s window. These background apps can stay notified, keep data synchronized, and update themselves. If youâ€™ve changed the appâ€™s settings and [stopped it from running in the background in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-background-apps/), Microsoft To Do will not sync unless youâ€™re actively using it.

 Hereâ€™s how you can allow it to run in the background:

1. Press **Windows key + I** to go to Windows Settings.
2. Head to **Apps > Installed apps**.
3. Find **Microsoft To Do** and click the **three-dot** icon next to it.
4. Select **Advanced options**.
