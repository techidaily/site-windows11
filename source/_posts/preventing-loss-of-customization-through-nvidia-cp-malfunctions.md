## Preventing Loss of Customization Through Nvidia CP Malfunctions

 The NVIDIA Control Panel is an important application that ships with your NVIDIA graphics card. It lets you change graphic settings, customize system resolution, refresh rate, color settings, and more. However, many users have complained about the NVIDIA Control Panel not saving settings.

 This can be exasperating, especially if you've spent hours setting your preferences. As such, if the NVIDIA Control Panel is not saving settings in Windows 11, try the below solutions to troubleshoot the problem for good.

## 1\. Temporarily Disable Your Security Program

 Security applications are designed to safeguard your system from malware and unauthorized access. However, they can sometimes interfere with trusted applications, like the NVIDIA Control Panel, and prevent them from making any changes to your system.

 In this situation, temporarily disabling your security program may help fix the problem. If you're using Windows Security, check out our guide on[temporarily disabling Windows Security on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/temporarily-disable-windows-security-windows-11/) .

 To disable a third-party security program, right-click on its icon present in the system tray area and choose**Disable** from the menu that crops up. Alternatively, you can check the security application user manual to know more about the disabling process.

## 2\. Download the Latest NVIDIA Graphics Driver Update

 We cannot stress enough the importance of having the latest graphics driver update installed on your computer. An updated graphics driver ensures that your system performs better with other peripherals and is free from driver-related issues.

 Although Windows does automatically update all system drivers, there may be times when you feel that the graphics driver is outdated or not working correctly. In such situations, you should manually[download the NVIDIA driver on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-update-nvidia-graphics-card-drivers-windows/) .

## 4\. Customize NVIDIA Corporation Folder Settings

 The NVIDIA Corporation folder contains all the important files and settings related to the NVIDIA graphics card driver. If you do not have permission to access or make changes to this folder, the NVIDIA Control Panel will fail to save settings.

 You'll have to modify the NVIDIA Corporation folder permissions to solve the issue. Here's how to do that:

1. Launch the**File Explorer** (see how to[open File Explorer in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) ) and go-to**C:\\Program Files** .
2. Right-click on the**NVIDIA Corporation** folder and choose**Properties.**
3. Switch to the**Security** tab and click the**Edit** button.
