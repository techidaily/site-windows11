## Reset Your Screen Quickly When Black Hits

 Windows may be one of the oldest and most popular operating systems, but it still has quirks. Both Windows 10 and Windows 11 come with a range of issues, well-known or otherwise, and users are often left to solve them for themselves.

 Finding yourself stuck with a Windows 10/11 black screen with a cursor is frustrating, but this article is here to help you with this issue. But how can you [fix Windows stuck on a black screen with just a cursor](https://www.passfab.com/windows-repair/how-to-fix-windows-11-black-screen-with-cursor.html) ?

## Why Is My Windows 10/11 Stuck on a Black Screen With Cursor?

 This issue is characterized by a blank black screen with nothing but a cursor on display. You can’t use your PC, you can’t log in, and may not be able to shut down your device.

 The [Windows 10/11 black screen with cursor](https://www.passfab.com/windows-tips/windows-10-11-black-screen-with-cursor.html) issue usually occurs after an update, blocking the user from logging into Windows to resolve it.

 Windows updates, driver updates, and other glitches can all be responsible for causing your screen to turn black, and this is why there are multiple solutions to the problem.
