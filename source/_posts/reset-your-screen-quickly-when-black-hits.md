## Reset Your Screen Quickly When Black Hits

 Windows may be one of the oldest and most popular operating systems, but it still has quirks. Both Windows 10 and Windows 11 come with a range of issues, well-known or otherwise, and users are often left to solve them for themselves.

 Finding yourself stuck with a Windows 10/11 black screen with a cursor is frustrating, but this article is here to help you with this issue. But how can you[fix Windows stuck on a black screen with just a cursor](https://www.passfab.com/windows-repair/how-to-fix-windows-11-black-screen-with-cursor.html) ?

## Why Is My Windows 10/11 Stuck on a Black Screen With Cursor?

 This issue is characterized by a blank black screen with nothing but a cursor on display. You can’t use your PC, you can’t log in, and may not be able to shut down your device.

 The[Windows 10/11 black screen with cursor](https://www.passfab.com/windows-tips/windows-10-11-black-screen-with-cursor.html) issue usually occurs after an update, blocking the user from logging into Windows to resolve it. It can also occur after you’ve logged into your machine, though this is less likely.

 Windows updates, driver updates, and other glitches can all be responsible for causing your screen to turn black, and this is why there are multiple solutions to the problem.

## Method 1: PassFab FixUWin

 This first method is the easiest on this list, enabling you to rely on third-party tools to handle the job for you. You can download and use[PassFab FixUWin](https://www.passfab.com/products/fix-windows.html) for free, enabling you to try it out and get started without having to commit to purchasing a copy for yourself.

 Head to the PassFab website and go to the FixUWin page. Click on**Free Trial** to download an executable file for your new software.

 Launch the executable file and click on**Install** once it opens, and wait for the install to finish before clicking on**Start** .

### Step 2: Create a New Windows Boot Disk/Drive

It will take a few minutes to create your new boot device.

### Step 3: Boot the Machine Using Your Boot Disk/Drive

 Shut down the PC with a black screen and cursor before inserting your disk or USB drive. Restart the computer and hit the key to access your boot menu as the machine starts up. This key is different for different manufacturers, but it is usually F12 or ESC.

 You may need to try a few times before your boot menu launches. Once it does, select your recovery disk or USB from the list and restart the machine to boot from it.

### Step 4: Start the PassFab FixUWin Automated Repair Process

 Rather than trying to boot back into Windows and triggering a black screen with a cursor, the PassFab FixUWin automatic repair tool will open. Click**Automated Repair** and choose the drive partition that holds Windows before hitting Start Repair.

 The repair process won’t take long and will give you a report once it is complete. You can try the additional methods if this one doesn’t work for you.
