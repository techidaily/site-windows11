## Creative Walls for Your PC: Windows 10/11 Guide

 There are many third-party apps with which you can annotate screenshots. However, there are far fewer annotation tools that enable users to draw directly on the Windows desktop.

 Epic Pen and gInk are two apps that enable you to seamlessly scribble on the Windows desktop and software as you would on a drawing board. This is how you can draw on the Windows 10 and 11 desktop with those apps.

## How to Draw on the Windows Desktop With Epic Pen

 Epic Pen is freemium software with limited functionality. The free version enables you to scribble on the screen in Windows 11/10, 8, and 7 with its pen and highlighter. However, tools for adding shapes, straight lines, and text are only available in Epic Pen Pro. You can download and install the basic Epic Pen software like this:

1. Open the[Epic Pen](https://epicpen.com/) website.
2. Click the**Download For Free** button to scroll down the homepage.
3. Select the**Download Epic Pen** option for the free version.
4. Find and double-click the**Epic Pen Setup v3.11.44.exe** file in whatever folder your browser usually downloads to.
5. Select**English** (or another preferred language) on the drop-down menu and click**OK** .
6. Deselect the**Start Epic Pen on Windows login** setting if you prefer the software not to be included within the startup, and click the installer’s**Next** option.  
![The Install button for Epic Pen](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-install-option2.jpg)
7. Select**I don’t want to use Epic Pen Pro right now** on the activation window to utilize the software without trial features. You can still activate the trial features later.  
![The I don't want to use Epic Pen Pro right now option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/epic-pen-setup-window.jpg)
8. Then you can select an**Enable Epic Pen Pro features for free** option to permanently unlock a Pro feature by opting into the Brightdata scheme for sharing your PC’s resources. You can opt into that scheme later if you wish, but to try out the basic version first click **I don’t want to enable free Epic Pen Pro features right now** .  
![The Brightdata scheme option for enabling Epic Pen Pro features](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/enable-epic-pen-pro-features-option.jpg)
9. Select**Finish** (with the**Launch** checkbox enabled) to start Epic Pen.

Now you can get scribbling on the Windows desktop.

### How to Use Epic Pen to Draw on Your Desktop

 Click the**pen** button on Epic Pen’s drawing toolbar. To change the pen width, click**pen size** and select smaller or larger options. You can select one of four colors on the toolbar’s palette. Hold down the**left mouse button** and move the cursor around to draw on your desktop.

 To eradicate pen strokes and highlights, click the**eraser** button. Then you can click on pen strokes and highlights to erase them. You can also clear all drawings from the screen by selecting the**clear screen** option.

 Epic Pen’s camera option enables you to save your drawings and annotations by[taking screenshots within Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/take-screenshot-windows-11/) . Click the**take screenshot** button to activate the screen-capture utility. Then drag the rectangle over the area of the desktop to capture, and click either the**save** or**copy to clipboard** option.

 Epic Pen has an arrow and shapes you can activate on a limited-time trial basis. Click the**line** option to select arrow, rectangle, or ellipse. Then select the**Start free trial** button.

 You can also permanently activate some of the features in Epic Pen Pro without splashing out for the upgrade by opting into its brightdata.com scheme. To do so, click**Menu** \>**Settings** . Select the**Enable the Text tool** or**Enable the Whiteboard tool** option to activate one of those features and share device resources.

## How to Draw on the Windows Desktop With gInk

 The gInk app is an open-source alternative to Epic Pen you can utilize for on-screen annotations in Windows 11/10 much the same. This is also a portable app for which no installation is needed. However, you’ll still need to download and extract the gInk archive like this:

1. Open the[gInk page](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Others/gInk.shtml) on Softpedia.
2. Press the**Download** button to bring up a couple of location options. Pick the one closest to your location and download the file.
3. Next, you’ll need to extract gInk’s ZIP file. Follow the guidelines in our article about[how to unzip files on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/) to extract the ZIP archive.  
![The Extract Compressed tool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/extract-compressed-window3.jpg)
4. Double-click**gInk.exe** inside the extracted gInk folder to launch the desktop drawing tool.

 Now you can try out the gInk on-screen drawing (or annotation) tool in Windows. Click the**Pen 1** option, and scribble on the desktop by holding the**left mouse button** and moving the cursor. You can also select three other pen options for different colors.

 The fifth pen is a transparent highlighter option. Click**Pen 5** to activate the tool’s highlighter. You can utilize this tool for highlighting things in presentations.

 You can adjust the drawing tool’s widths by selecting**Pen width** . Drag the slider along the bar to increase or decrease the width of your pen.

 The gInk toolbar includes a screenshot tool you can use for taking snapshots of what you’ve drawn on the desktop. Click the**Snapshot** (camera) button on the app’s toolbar to activate it. Drag the rectangle around an area to include in the captured output to take the picture. That snapshot will automatically save to a folder path specified within gInk’s**General** tab.

 The gInk app includes five pens on its toolbar by default, but you can add four more. To do so, you’ll need to close gInk’s toolbar first by clicking its**Exit** drawing option. Then right-click the gInk system tray icon and select**Options** .

 Click the**Pens** tab on the**Options** window, and select the checkboxes for additional pens. You can also configure the pens’ colors and widths from that tab by clicking the palette boxes and**Width** drop-down menus for them.

 You can also set custom hotkeys for accessing the pens. Click the**Hotkeys** tab to view gInk’s default keyboard shortcuts. Then click inside one of the**Pen** boxes and press an alternative hotkey to set one.

## Get Scribbling on Your Windows Desktop With These Apps

 Epic Pen and gInk are intuitive and straightforward to utilize apps with drawing tools that enable you to annotate what’s on your desktop for illustrative purposes. They’re great for showing information on Windows PCs presenting a screencast, projection, or video conference, and they can even capture annotated screenshots.
