## Stop the Screeching Corkscrew of Your Mouse Wheel

 You want to scroll using the mouse wheel but notice something strange. Instead of scrolling on a file, page, or folder, the mouse wheel is zooming in or out instead.

 In most cases, this occurs when the Ctrl key is stuck. However, this might also be something that stems from various system issues. So, let’s check out all the possible solutions that could help you tackle this problem.

## 1\. Ensure the Ctrl Key Isn’t Stuck

 You’re likely to come across this issue if the Ctrl key is stuck. That’s because pressing Ctrl and using the mouse wheel usually zooms in or out on a page. So, just take a look at the Ctrl key and ensure that it’s not stuck or damaged.

 Are you one of those people who like[switching and remapping the keys on a Windows device](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap-fix-keyboard-layout/) ? If so, then you’d need to ensure that the key that has replaced the Ctrl button isn’t stuck.

 Not able to tell if the Ctrl key is stuck or not? If so, try using the on-screen keyboard.

## 2\. Use the On-Screen Keyboard to Ensure the Ctrl Key Isn’t Stuck

 Sometimes, it might be a bit tricky to spot a stuck Ctrl key on your Windows PC. In such instances, the on-screen keyboard could help.

Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run command dialog box.
2. Type**osk** and press**Enter** to open the on-screen keyboard.
3. Check the color of the**Ctrl keys** on the on-screen keyboard. If the keys are blue, then it means they’re pressed or stuck.
