## Boost Efficiency: Best Keys for Auto Clicking

 Auto Clickers are often used by gamers where repeated mouse clicks are needed. However, you can also use an auto clicker as a productivity tool. An auto clicker can automate mouse clicks with a keyboard shortcut to reduce frequent switching between a mouse and a keyboard.

 Auto clickers allow you to set a click position and then assign a shortcut key to trigger the click. Pressing the keyboard shortcut will emulate the right, left, or middle key per the configuration. Below, we explore the best auto clicker for Windows to automate mouse clicks using a keyboard shortcut.

## 1\. Auto Clicker by Polar

 Auto Clicker by Polar lets you configure multiple mouse actions with a keyboard shortcut. To configure a cursor location, open the app you want to use and click on**Pick Cursor Position** . Next, click the item you want to automate and click**Add position** to save the cursor position. Repeat the steps if you need to automate multiple actions.

 To trigger the saved action, open the app and press the default**F6** shortcut key. Press the key again to trigger the next action. To change the hotkey, open**Options** , click**Start/Stop** and press the keyboard combo you want to assign. Click**Stop** and**OK** to save the new shortcut key.

 OP AutoClicker is a full-fledged mouse-click automation tool. It features two modes for the cursor position. You can select a current location or specify the X and Y coordinates with the Pick location option.

 It is similar to Auto Clicker by Polar but lacks the multiple mouse actions feature. However, it features a**Record** and**Playback** feature to record keyboard and mouse actions and automate the recorded actions. You can specify the mouse button, click type, and click interval. You can change the keyboard default keyboard shortcut using the hotkey settings

 GS Auto Clicker is a lightweight Windows auto-clicker application. It is primarily useful if you want to perform repetitive tasks in games or your workflow.

 It doesnâ€™t offer many customization options. The single-click action is triggered with the default**F8** key. Furthermore, you can select the mouse button and click style (single or double), record, and playback to perform a group of mouse actions. By default, it uses F8 as the hotkey, but you can remap the shortcut in Options.

 In addition, you can also customize the click action speed and auto-auto clicker delay and emulate the latency of a human click. You can also record and replay the steps to automate a multi-mouse action.

 If you need more advanced mouse-click automation tools, explore [PTFB Pro](https://www.ptfbpro.com/download.shtml) . You can use it as an auto clicker, macro reader, and system app monitor. Then there is [Murgeee Auto Clicker](https://www.murgee.com/auto-clicker/) to configure and automate the left, right, and middle mouse buttons with a keyboard shortcut. You can also [use the built-in Windows Task Scheduler to run programs automatically](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-automate-windows-programs-on-a-schedule/) . Although, it is more of a program and task automation utility and not an auto-clicker.

 There are plenty of other auto-clicker apps available for Windows that we did not consider in this list. While some are dated, others ran into security issues with our antivirus. Some of these apps can be too complicated for an average user and involve a steep learning curve.
