## Boost Efficiency: Best Keys for Auto Clicking

 Auto Clickers are often used by gamers where repeated mouse clicks are needed. However, you can also use an auto clicker as a productivity tool. An auto clicker can automate mouse clicks with a keyboard shortcut to reduce frequent switching between a mouse and a keyboard.

 Auto clickers allow you to set a click position and then assign a shortcut key to trigger the click. Pressing the keyboard shortcut will emulate the right, left, or middle key per the configuration. Below, we explore the best auto clicker for Windows to automate mouse clicks using a keyboard shortcut.

## 1\. Auto Clicker by Polar

 Auto Clicker by Polar lets you configure multiple mouse actions with a keyboard shortcut. To configure a cursor location, open the app you want to use and click on**Pick Cursor Position** . Next, click the item you want to automate and click**Add position** to save the cursor position. Repeat the steps if you need to automate multiple actions.

 To trigger the saved action, open the app and press the default**F6** shortcut key. Press the key again to trigger the next action. To change the hotkey, open**Options** , click**Start/Stop** and press the keyboard combo you want to assign. Click**Stop** and**OK** to save the new shortcut key.

 GS Auto Clicker is a lightweight Windows auto-clicker application. It is primarily useful if you want to perform repetitive tasks in games or your workflow.

By default, it uses F8 as the hotkey, but you can remap the shortcut in Options.
