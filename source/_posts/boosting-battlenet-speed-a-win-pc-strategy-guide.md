## Boosting Battle.net Speed: A Win-PC Strategy Guide

 Battle.net is a popular game launcher client and home to many blockbuster games, but sometimes, Battle.net takes forever to download a game. While there isn't much you can do if you have a weak connection, there are a few changes you can make within the Battle.net settings and Windows to increase the download speed.

 As such, here are some ways to boost your Battle.net download speed on Windows

## What Causes a Slow Download Speed in Battle.net?

 It's very common to experience slow download speed in game launchers. Thankfully, it's very easy to troubleshoot the problem if it is caused due to misconfigured in-app or Windows settings.

 Some of the common culprits behind slow download speed in Battle.net are:

1. Your internet connection is weak.
2. The Battle.net app is working with a small amount of bandwidth.
3. Your computer doesn't have the latest network driver updates.
4. You're using a proxy server.

 Now that you're aware of all the common culprits let's check out what you can do to improve the connection.

## 1\. Allocate Adequate Bandwidth to Battle.net

 The first thing you must do is allocate adequate bandwidth to the Battle.net app. You can do this by pausing other downloads running in the background and closing network-hogging applications. Also, ensure that streaming applications like Twitch are not running in the background.

 You can identify and manage network-consuming applications with the help of the Task Manager. Here's what you need to do:

1. Open the Task Manager (see [how to open the Task Manager in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-open-task-manager-windows-10/) ) and select the**Processes** tab in the left panel.
2. Look in the**Network** column, right-click on all the non-essential applications and choose**End task.**

 Furthermore, make sure that the Efficiency mode isn't configured for Battle.net. The efficiency mode decreases the priority of an application. To get more information about efficiency mode and the steps to disable it, check out our [guide on efficiency mode](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-task-manager-efficiency-mode/#how-to-enable-or-disable-efficiency-mode) .

## 2\. Turn Off Windows' Metered Connection

 Windows has a metered connection feature that lets you control your bandwidth usage. This feature is mainly designed to save data, especially if you're under a data cap. It also affects how an app uses the available bandwidth.

 As such, if you have Windows' metered connection feature enabled, it might slow down Battle.net's download speed. Here's how to turn it off:

1. Open the Settings menu by pressing the**Win + I** hotkeys.
2. Choose**Network** **& internet** from the left panel.
3. Select**Wi-Fi,** and then choose your**Wi-Fi** connection.
4. Disable the toggle next to**Metered connection.**  
![Metered Connection option in the Settings menu](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Metered-Connection.jpg)

 That's it. Restart Battle.net, and check if there's any improvement in the download speed.

## 3\. Troubleshoot Your Connection

 A weak internet connection might be affecting Battle.net's download speed. You can confirm this by testing your connection speed by visiting any of the [best speed test websites](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-websites-test-internet-speed/) .

 If you're getting a comparatively lower download speed, check out our guide on [how to improve your internet connection](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-improve-internet-speed/) . If this helps improve your internet connection, try downloading games on Battle.net. But if there's no improvement in your connection, contact your internet service provider (ISP).

## 4\. Disable Any Proxy Server Connection

 A [proxy server](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-proxy-server/) ensures that you're safe and protected online. But on the negative side, it can make the connection unstable and slow down the download speed.

 You can try disabling any active proxy and check if it improves the download speed. Here's how:

1. Launch the**Start Menu** by pressing the**Win** key.
2. In the search bar, type**Internet options** and press Enter.
3. Switch to the**Connections** tab.
4. Click the**LAN settings** option and uncheck the**Use** **a proxy server for your LAN** box.  
![Turn off proxy on Internet Options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Turn-off-proxy.jpg)
5. Save the changes by clicking the**OK** button.

## 5\. Download the Latest Network Driver Updates

 The next fix to try to download the latest network driver update. As it turns out, an outdated or corrupt network driver can cause various network issues, including the slow download speed in Battle.net.

To update the network driver update, follow the below instructions:

1. Press the**Win + X** hotkeys to open the**Power menu.**
2. Choose**Device Manager** from the context menu.
3. Right-click on the installed network adapters and select**Update driver.**  
![Update Network Drivers on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Update-Network-Drivers-on-Windows.jpg)
4. Choose**Search automatically for drivers.**

 Windows will now look for and download the latest network driver update. If it finds nothing, search for the network adapter's manufacturer's official website for drivers instead.

After that, restart your computer and check for the issue again.

## 6\. Clear the Battle.net Cache Data

 Battle.net stores cache data to offer faster access. Sometimes, this cache folder can get corrupted and affect your download speed. You'll have to delete the content of this folder to solve the problem. Don't worry; deleting this folder will not affect your game data.

1. Press the**Win + R** hotkeys to open the**Run** dialog box.
2. In the search bar, type**%ProgramData%** and click**OK.**
3. Locate and right-click on the**Blizzard Entertainment** folder.  
![Blizzard Folder in File Explorer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blizzard-Folder.jpg)
4. Choose the**Delete** option.

## 7\. Flush the DNS Cache

 Flushing the DNS cache is another effective way to improve the download speed in Battle.net. You can do this by following the below instructions:

1. In the Start Menu search bar, type "Command Prompt" and choose**Run as administrator** from the right pane.
2. Type the following command and press**Enter** .  
`ipconfig /flushdns`

 After flushing the DNS cache, restart your computer and check for the problem.

## 8\. Reset the Network Settings

 Is there still no improvement in Battle.net download speed? Probably there's something wrong with your current network settings.

You can fix this by resetting the network settings. Here's how:

1. Open the Settings menu, and select**Network & Internet** from the left panel.
2. Choose**Advanced network settings,** and then select**Network reset.**
3. Click the**Reset now** button.  
![The Reset now button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/the-network-reset-button.jpg)
4. Click**Yes** to the prompt that appears to confirm your selection.

## Improve Your Battle.net Download Speed

 Nobody loves to wait for several hours to download their favorite games on Battle.net. Fortunately, you can fix the slow download speed on Battle.net by following the above fixes.

 But in the worst-case scenario, if you're still facing the problem, then the problem may be off your computer and lie within your network. As such, make sure your network is running as well as it should be.
