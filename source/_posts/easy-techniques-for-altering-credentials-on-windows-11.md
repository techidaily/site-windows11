## Easy Techniques for Altering Credentials on Windows 11

 Despite Microsoft’s attempt to push more users towards adopting the Windows Hello-based sign-in options, the old password-based login is still part of Windows 11\. And for a good reason.

 Even if you prefer a PIN over the conventional password sign-in, you can set an account password as a backup option. It is a handy way to sign in if you forget your PIN or encounter an error. But what if you have forgotten your account password? Let's explore the many ways to change your account password in Windows 11.
