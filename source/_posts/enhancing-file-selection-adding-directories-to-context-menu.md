### How to Tweak Right Click Context Menu Adder

 There are a few optional settings you can change when adding folders to the context menu with Right Click Context Menu Adder. To change the shortcut’s position, select a different**Position on Menu** option.

 You can change the shortcut's label by entering something different in the**Text On Menu** box. If you select**Show only when Shift key** is pressed, the shortcut will only be visible if you activate the context menu with the**Shift** key pressed.

 An**Enable Aero Glass** setting is selected by default in Right Click Context Menu Adder. That setting can make this software’s tab text somewhat unclear in Windows 11\. So, it’s best to disable that option by selecting the**Settings** tab (the third one from the right) and deselecting the**Enable Aero Glass** checkbox. Then the tabs will have clear black text.
