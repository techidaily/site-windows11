## Unseen Windows Firewall Protection Sectors Demystified

 Do you share your computer with someone else and not want them to access your Firewall & Network protection settings? If yes, then this is the place where you need to be.

 In this article, we'll see how you can hide or show the Firewall & Network protection settings area in Windows Security.

 One of these is the Firewall & Network protection area. This is where you can view the Microsoft Defender Firewall status and the type of networks your device is connected to. You can also use it to [block or allow an app through the firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/) and reset firewall settings.
