## Tweak Right-Menu Options for Optimal Software Use

 There are many ways to run the Compatibility Troubleshooter, but the easiest way is to do it from the context menu by right-clicking on a program and selecting**Troubleshoot Compatibility** . However, sometimes, this option can go missing, and the good news is that you can add it back with a couple of registry tweaks. Keep on reading to find out how.

## What to Do Before Tweaking the Registry Editor

 Before you go about making big changes to your Windows PC, it’s always a good idea to have some sort of backup in case things go wrong. To do that, we highly recommend reading our guide on[creating a system restore with Command Prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-create-restore-point-command-prompt-powershell/) . If you want, you can also read our other guide on[how to back up and restore the Windows registry](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) if you want to have a copy of it somewhere.

## How to Add a "Troubleshoot Compatibility" Option to the Context Menu With the Registry Editor

 Now that you know how to keep the Windows registry safe, it's time to change it with the Registry Editor. We are going to start by adding the**Troubleshoot Compatibility** option to the context menu for EXE files. Afterward, the steps for adding it to other programs are going to be similar. To do that, follow the steps below:

1. Press**Win + R** to open the Run dialog box, enter**regedit** in the text box, and hit the**Enter** key to open the Registry Editor.
2. First, we are going to add the Troubleshoot Compatibility option for the EXE files. Start by copying and pasting the below key path in the address of the Registry Editor and hit the**Enter** key:  
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\cmdfile\shellEx\ContextMenuHandlers
3. Right-click the**ContextMenuHandlers** key and then select**New > Key** and name it**Compatibility** . If it is already there, move on to the next step.

4. Select the**Compatibility** key, double-click**Default** on the right, and set**Value data** to**{1d27f844-3a1f-4410-85ac-14651078412d}** .

 Next, you’re going to repeat the steps above to add the**Troubleshoot Compatibility** to the context menu of other BAT and CMD files. Just replace the key path in step two with**HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\\batfile\\shellEx\\ContextMenuHandlers\\** for BAT files and**HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\\cmdfile\\shellEx\\ContextMenuHandlers\\** for CMD files.

 Now when you right-click an EXE, BAT, or CMD file, you should see the**Troubleshoot Compatibility** option in the context menu.
