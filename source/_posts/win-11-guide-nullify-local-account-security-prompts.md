## Win 11 Guide: Nullify Local Account Security Prompts

 Windows operating system provides various security features to protect user accounts, and local account security questions are one such feature. This adds another layer of security as it requires you to answer previously set questions.

 If you find these security questions more of a hassle than a safety measure, you can disable them. This guide explains how to disable local account security questions on Windows 11\.

## How to Disable Local Account Security Questions on Windows

 There are three ways to disable local account security questions in Windows 11\. You can use the Group Policy Editor, the Registry Editor, or a Reg File. Here we explain each method in detail.

## 1\. Using Group Policy Editor

 To disable local account security questions on your computer, use the Group Policy Editor. However, this method applies only to Pro and Enterprise editions. See our guide on [how to access the Local Group Policy Editor in Windows Home](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/).

1. Press **Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run command dialog box.
2. Type **gpedit.msc** in the text box and hit Enter. The Local Group Policy Editor will then appear.
3. From the left-side navigation pane, expand to the following path:  
`Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Credential User Interface`
4. On the right-side panel, double-click on the **Prevent the use of security questions for local accounts** policy.

5. In the Properties window, select the **Enabled** radio button.

6. Then click on **Apply** \> **OK** to save changes.

 This will instantly disable the security questions for the account you are currently logged into. If you have to disable the feature for other accounts, log in as that user and repeat the steps.

 To enable the security questions again, navigate to the same policy and select **Disabled** or **Not Configured** in the Properties window. This will enable local account security questions for all accounts. That's how to disable or enable local account security questions in Windows 11\.

## 2\. Using Registry Editor

 The Registry Editor is another way to disable local account security questions on Windows. It requires you to modify registry values. Here's how to do it:

1. Press **Win + Q** on your keyboard to open the search panel.
2. Type **regedit** in the text box and hit Enter. This will open the Registry Editor window.
3. From the left-side navigation panel, navigate to the following registry key:  
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System`
4. If you don’t find the **System** key, you must create one. For that, right-click on the **Windows** folder and select **New** \> **Key**. Name the newly created key **System**.
5. Once you’ve created the System key, right-click on it and select **New > DWORD (32-bit) Value**.

## 3\. Using a Reg File

 If you don’t want to edit the registry manually, create a Reg file instead. This is a simple and quick way to disable local account security questions on Windows. It's especially useful for users without Group Policy Editor access or who prefer not to use Registry Editor.

1. Open Notepad (see [how to open Notepad](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-notepad/) for methods).
2. Copy and paste the following code into it:  
`<code>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System]  
"NoLocalPasswordResetQuestions"=-`
3. Click on **File** \> **Save as**.
4. Select **All Files** from the **Save as type** drop-down menu.

6. Now double-click on the reg file to execute it.

 This will create a new registry value in the System key and immediately disable local account security questions in Windows 11\. To enable the feature again, delete the **DisableSecurityQuestions.reg** file from your desktop and restart the computer.
