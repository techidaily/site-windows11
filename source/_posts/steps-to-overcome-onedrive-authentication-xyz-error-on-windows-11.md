## Steps to Overcome ONEDRIVE Authentication XYZ Error on Windows 11

 Microsoft's cloud storage service OneDrive simplifies file management on Windows. However, you might experience issues when signing in to OneDrive, like the 0x8004dec5 error. This article will guide you on how to resolve OneDrive sign-in error 0x8004dec5 specifically on Windows 11\.

## 1\. Check Your Internet Connection

 If you’re having trouble signing in to OneDrive, first [check your internet connection](http://www.makeuseof.com/windows-check-wifi-network-strength/). Slow or spotty internet causes sign-in problems. So, check your connection speed and make sure it’s strong enough for OneDrive. If necessary, reset your router or modem to restore the connection.

 If your internet connection is working, restart your computer and sign in to OneDrive again. This simple step fixes minor errors in the operating system that may cause the sign-in issue.

## 2\. Run the Network Troubleshooter

 If your internet connection is stable, but you’re still having OneDrive sign-in problems, you can run the Internet Connections Troubleshooter. This diagnosis tool scans for network problems and repairs any issues it finds.

 To run the Internet Connection Troubleshooter, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on Start and select **Run** from the menu list.

3. Click **Advanced** and check **Apply repairs automatically**.

4. Now click **Next** and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the troubleshooting process.

 Once it’s done, sign into OneDrive and see if the error is fixed. If not, try the next solution.

## 3\. Tweak the Registry Editor

 If the problem persists, remove cached Office account identities from the registry. This requires changing a few settings in the Windows registry which is a database of your operating system, so proceed with caution.

 If you’re not sure what you’re doing, have an experienced technician make the changes for you. To avoid damaging your system, [create a registry backup](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before making these changes.

1. Press **Win + R** on your keyboard to open the Run dialog.
2. Type **regedit** in the search box and click **OK**.

4. In the Registry Editor window, navigate to the path as follows:  
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Identity`
5. Right-click on the **Identity** folder and select **Delete** from the menu.

`C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneAuth  
`
5. Select all the files here and hit the **Delete** button.

 Once you've removed all cached Office account identities, restart your computer and try signing in to OneDrive again.

## 5\. Unlink and Re-Link Your OneDrive Account
