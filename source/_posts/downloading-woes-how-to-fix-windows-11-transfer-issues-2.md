## Downloading Woes: How to Fix Windows 11 Transfer Issues (2)

 Most users get their software, drivers, and updates through the internet. However, some users have reported in IT support forums that they can’t download files with any of their Windows web browsers. Nothing happens when they click links to download files with their browsers.

 Not being able to download files with browsers is a serious Windows issue. If you can’t download files with Edge or any other of your installed browsers, this is how you can fix files not downloading on a Windows 10 or 11 PC.

## 1\. Free Up Drive Storage Space

 First, we recommend you check how much free space is available on your PC’s hard drive. You might not be able to download any files because your PC’s hard drive has hardly any free space left on it. Check out [how to check your local drive storage](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-check-locak-drive-storage-space/) for several methods on how to view how much space is left on a drive.

 Clean your local drive if it has less than two gigabytes of free storage space. You can free up some drive space by uninstalling software packages, utilizing the Disk Clean-up tool, and deleting user files. Our guide to [freeing up storage space on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-free-up-storage-space/) provides step-by-step instructions for the various methods.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. Run the SFC and DISM Command-Line Tools

![The SFC scannow command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/sfc-scannow.jpg)

 Another possibility is that something has gone wrong with Windows' system files. So, try [repairing corrupted Windows files with Windows' built-in tools](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-built-in-repair-tools/), specifically the System File Checker and the Deployment Image Servicing and Management command-line tools.

 The SFC tool patches up corrupted files and DISM addresses system image issues.

## 3\. Select a Different Download Location in Your Browser

 Most Windows browsers download files to the Downloads user folder by default. There could be an issue with that folder. In this case, selecting a different download location with browser settings might work for some users.

 Our article about [changing the default download location in browsers](https://www.makeuseof.com/change-default-download-location-popular-browsers/) tells you how to apply this potential resolution with Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Change the Current Location in the Website Data Settings

 This downloading issue can occur because the current location in Internet Properties isn’t set to a local C: drive. You can check and change that current location within Internet Properties as follows:

1. Activate the search box (press the **Windows** logo + **S** key combination).
2. Enter **internet options** in the search box.
3. Click **Internet Options** to view the Internet Properties window.
4. Next, click **Settings** on the **General** tab.

5. If the current location is not set to your local C: drive, click on the **Move folder** button.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
6. Select a folder on your PC’s C: drive and click **OK**.
7. Then click **Yes** on the logoff prompt.

 We also recommend checking some security settings in Internet Properties. Click **Custom level** on the **Security** tab. Make sure the **File download** and **Font download** options are enabled there. If they’re not, select the **Enable** radio buttons for those settings and click **OK**.

## 5\. Run an Antivirus Scan

 Malware is another potential cause for your browsers not downloading files since it can cause many kinds of internet-related issues. If you have third-party antivirus software installed, run an antivirus scan with that app to check for and purge malware. Or you can run a manual antivirus can with Windows Security like this:

1. Double-click Windows Security’s shield icon inside the system tray.
2. Click **Scan options** on the View & threat protection tab.  
![The Scan options navigation option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scan-options.jpg)
3. Select **Full scan** for the most thorough antivirus scanning.
4. Click **Scan now** to start the scanning.  
![full-scan-options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/full-scan-options.jpg)
5. Select **Start actions** to eradicate detected malware.

## 6\. Disable Any Active Third-Party Antivirus Utilities

 Third-party antivirus apps shouldn't stop you from downloading any files. However, they can interfere with downloads when set to the highest protection settings. To check if a third-party security app is causing this issue, right-click on its antivirus system tray icon and select an option for temporarily disabling its shield. Then try to download a file in your browser again.

![Disable Avast antivirus temporarily](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/disable-avast.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2097467/26400?prodsku=B700" target="_top" id="2097467"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2097467" border="0" alt="" width="640" height="640"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2097467/26400" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If this works, you can’t risk leaving antivirus protection off for too long. Consider uninstalling your antivirus utility and re-enabling real-time protection in the pre-installed Windows Security app. Or look for some settings in your security software to reduce the level of its antivirus protection.

## 7\. Temporarily Turn Off the Windows Firewall Utility

 Windows Defender Firewall is a security utility that monitors inbound and outbound network traffic on your PC. This tool can affect file downloads when set to block connections. So, try [turning off Windows Defender Firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-microsoft-defender-firewall/) to see if that makes a difference.

![The Turn off Windows Defender Firewall (not recommended) radio button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/windows-firewall-options.jpg)

 If disabling Windows Defender Firewall works, it’s not a good idea to leave it off. Resetting that firewall to its default configuration will likely disable the rules causing the issue. To do that, click the **Restore defaults** in the Windows Defender Firewall Control Panel applet. Then click the **Restore defaults** button.

## 8\. Reset Your Browser Software

 You can reinstall your browser when you can’t download anything (unless you still have its setup file). However, you can still reset your web browser, which is like reinstalling.

 Resetting a browser restores it to its original default configuration, clears temporary data, and disables or removes extensions. It's among the best troubleshooting methods for resolving more extreme browser issues.

 This guide to [resetting Chrome and Firefox](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/reset-chrome-firefox/) tells you how to apply this possible fix with those browsers. If you use Edge, you can reset your browser as follows:

1. Type **edge://settings/** into Edge’s address bar and hit **Enter**.
2. Click **Reset settings** in the sidebar.  
![The Reset settings tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/reset-settings-tab.jpg)

3. Press the **Restore settings** button.
4. Click **Reset** inside the confirmation prompt.

## 9\. Factory Reset Window

 If you still can’t download files after applying all the other resolutions above, there could be a deeper Windows issue that needs addressing. Resetting Windows involves a full reinstallation and will usually fix most system issues. It’s not an ideal resolution because you will need to reinstall all of your third-party software after applying it.

 However, the "Reset this PC" tool does have an option for keeping user files. So, there’s no need to back up your user files before a reset. Follow the instructions in this [how to factory reset Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-factory-reset-windows-computer/) article to apply this potential fix with the Reset this PC utility.

 Some of the best third-party Windows repair utilities could also be useful for fixing this issue, but the resolutions above will probably be sufficient.
