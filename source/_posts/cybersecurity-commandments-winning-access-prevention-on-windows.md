## Cybersecurity Commandments: Winning Access Prevention on Windows

 Leaving your Windows vulnerable to unbridled outside access is the last thing you want as a modern computer worker. Whether you realize it or not, your PC stores tons of information about you; a sudden breach can, therefore, result in more damage than just data loss.

 This is what makes preventing unauthorized access so important. So, how can you protect yourself from an uninvited digital guest? Let's learn how.

## What's the Point of Security Measures Against Unauthorized Windows Access?

 At its core, using strong security measures on your Windows is really just about that: keeping your security tight, so you are not open to abrupt attacks.

 For example, if you use your Windows computer in a public environment like a library or cafe, you will inadvertently make yourself vulnerable to network hacks of different sorts. Similarly, if your computer is accessed by many people, a lack of solid safety measures can turn out to be very costly.

 Putting in strong checks against such attacks, therefore, is essential. Let's look at all possible options on Windows.

## 1\. Use a Strong PIN or Password

 Passwords are often the first things that spring to mind when you think of security. It's for a good reason.

 A strong password works like a digital lock, only letting in the people who enter the correct passcode. So if you work on a public network or if your PC is accessed by more than one person, you should have a strong password or PIN in place since yesterday.

[Setting up a PIN on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/setup-remove-pin-windows-11/) is slightly different from putting a password on Windows. While both carry out a similar function, you might prefer one over the other depending on your interests. Whatever option you pick, make sure you always have a strong account encryption set up for your Windows from here on.

## 2\. Set Up Two-Factor Authentication on Your Microsoft Account

 Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a common defense tactic for improving your account's security. As its name suggests, 2FA works by requiring two contact methods: your password and a contact method (which will be a security code sent to your phone or email).

 So, after you have set up 2FA, even if someone manages to figure out your password, they will also need the contact code that's received to your email or phone after you enter the password. Naturally, this makes unauthorized access to your Windows account extremely difficult.

## 3\. Enable Windows Security

 While securing your PC from unknown physical access is a massive part of cyber-protection, it's not the only one. Today, Malware of enumerable type plagues the cyber-world.

 Weak antivirus protection can let any malware get an easy foothold on your PC, and from there, it's far too easy to obtain unauthorized access or take other malicious actions on your PC. [Enabling Windows Security](https://www.makeuseof.com/enable-windows-security-app-windows-10/) and setting up the best protection practices will be your best bet against such unauthorized action.

## 4\. Use a Firewall

![windows firewall](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/winodws-firewall.jpg)

 Another critical aspect of Windows security, or any network for that matter, is a firewall. A firewall works by monitoring the traffic going in and out of your PC. Depending on the set rules, a firewall works by quickly blocking out any unauthorized entering or leaving of data from your PC.

 On Windows, this firewall is called the Windows Firewall, which you can enable or disable with the help of Windows Security. So be sure to [set up Windows Firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-firewall-control-panel/) and you will be good to go.

## 5\. Use BitLocker

 BitLocker works by encrypting the disk data on your Windows and works as a great second layer of defense. So, even if someone manages to access your PC, in the case of a theft, for example, they won't be able to access your data without a key.

 As such, [enabling BitLocker on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/bitlocker-windows-11-guide/) is a great hack to boost your computer's security.

## 6\. Keep Your Windows Updated

![update on windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/update-on-windows.jpg)

 Windows updates are a vital component for any PC. They patch up recurring bugs and bring in new features. Most importantly, they install the latest Windows security updates.

 These regular updates are crucial to protect yourself from ever-evolving malware and hacks in the 21st century. So, make sure you have enabled automatic updates on your Windows, or at least [manually get your Windows updates regularly](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/).

[Social engineering](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/social-engineering-makeuseof-explains/) is about using clever hacks and manipulating people into giving or stealing their personal information. It makes use of the common weaknesses in human nature to break into otherwise strong systems.

 While it is a massive topic in itself, we will give you three quick tips to stay safe from social engineering hacks:

1. **Email Protection:** Stay vigilant about emails. Do not open emails from unknown or fishy sources, especially if they carry attachments like PDFs, images, etc.
2. **Stay alert about Vishing attacks:** Similar to phishing scams, Vishing attacks work by impersonating a real organization looking to help or protect you from a problem. The attacker might call you in the form of tech support, a bank employee, or even the police, and then try to get sensitive information such as email IDs, passwords, or OTPs.
3. **Scareware:** Scareware works by throwing fake, alarming messages. The aim, as the scam's name suggests, is to scare users into entering their sensitive information.

 We have listed just a handful of examples and you can find a whole [list of social engineering attacks](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/protect-8-social-engineering-attacks/) if you'd like to dig deeper.

 Because social engineering scams involve fooling humans, there are limited tech hacks to counter them. In fact, the most significant way to avoid them is by being mindful of the present moment and refraining from taking instant reactions.
