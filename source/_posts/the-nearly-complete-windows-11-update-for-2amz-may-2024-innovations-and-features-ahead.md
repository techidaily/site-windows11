## The Nearly Complete Windows 11 Update for 2Amz, May 2024: Innovations and Features Ahead!

Windows 11 is sticking to roughly the same release schedule as Windows 10, with one major update per year. Windows 11 24H2 is due later this year as the major revamp for 2024, and now we're one step closer to the final release.

 Microsoft has released the latest feature update for Windows 11, version 24H2, to its Release Preview Channel. This offers [Windows Insiders](https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-deciphering-tiktoks-pfp-code-a-thorough-analysis/) an early look at the annual update before its official release later this year. This particular step is notable because it usually means that the upcoming update is now feature completeâ€”at this point, Microsoft is usually done adding new features and starts focusing on actually polishing out the update's rougher edges before the final general rollout. As such, Insiders checking this particular build out, and all builds released following this one, should more or less resemble what the upcoming update will look like.

 The 24H2 update boasts a variety of new features, including HDR background support, an energy saver, Sudo for Windows, Rust in the Windows kernel, [Wi-Fi 7 support](https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/in-depth-look-at-the-updated-ratchet-and-clank-experience/), and improved voice clarity. Users can also expect a scrollable quick settings menu, the ability to [create 7-zip and TAR archives](https://driver-error.techidaily.com/idt-software-update-solving-unrecognized-device-issues-effectively/) in File Explorer, and enhanced Bluetooth Low Energy Audio device connectivity.

 It should be noted here that new AI features announced earlier this week, such as [Recall](https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/leveraging-chatgpt-for-effective-meditation-routines-a-step-by-step-guide/), will not be available in this preview as they require a [Copilot+ PC](https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-stop-my-spouse-from-spying-on-my-motorola-moto-g24-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). These PCs include an NPU, and it's not clear whether existing PCs with an NPU, such as Intel Core Ultra-powered PCs, will be getting these features or not. Microsoft has also revamped the Copilot experience, making it a standalone app pinned to the taskbar for easier access and customization.

 Windows Insiders on the Release Preview Channel can now download and install 24H2 through Windows Update. Commercial customers can also begin validating the update within their organizations via Windows Update for Business and Windows Server Update Service. ISOs for Windows 11, version 24H2 are also available for download on the Windows Insider ISO download page. As always, we should remind you that you shouldn't check these out unless you're comfortable with beta-grade software.
