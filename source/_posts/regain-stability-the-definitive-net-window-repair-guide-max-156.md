1. Go to the[.NET Framework download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework) .
2. Under the**Supported versions** section, click on the**.NET Framework** version you want to download.
3. On the next page, click on**Download .NET Framework XX Runtime.**
4. Once the download is complete, open the download location and run the**dotnetfx.exe** file to launch the setup. Click**Yes** , if prompted by UAC.
5. Next, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.
6. Restart your PC and then try to install the app to see if it works.

## 5\. Run the System File Checker Tool

![run system file check dism windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/run-system-file-check-dism-windows-11.jpeg)

 The System File Checker tool is a built-in system repair utility that finds and fixes missing or corrupted system files. You can use the tool to fix any system issues that may conflict with the .NET Framework.

To run the System File Checker tool:

1. Press the**Win key** and type**cmd** .
2. Right-click on**Command Prompt** from the search result and select**Run as administrator.**
3. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press Enter:  
`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`
4. The above DISM command is recommended to run before the System File Checker tool as it will provide files required to fix system file corruption.
5. Once the process is complete, run the following command and press Enter:  
`sfc /scannow`

 The SFC tool will now scan your system files for issues and replace any corrupted files as necessary. Wait for the verification process to complete.
