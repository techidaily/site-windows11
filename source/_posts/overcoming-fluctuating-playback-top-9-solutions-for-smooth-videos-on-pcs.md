## Overcoming Fluctuating Playback: Top 9 Solutions for Smooth Videos on PCs

 It can be hard to enjoy a video on your Windows PC when it's stuttering throughout, considering you can't see what's happening on the screen clearly. There are many reasons why this might happen, and it can be hard to pinpoint the exact cause.

 In this guide, we're going to look into several solutions to help you get rid of a video stuttering problem on Windows.

## 1\. Make Sure the Video or Media Player Isn't the Problem

 Before you start doing the more advanced fixes, you need to rule out the possibility that there's something wrong with the video file you're trying to play. To do that, simply play another video and see if that one too is stuttering. If it isn't, then you know the original video you tried to play has a problem.

 If the other video stutters as well, then check if the media player has a problem. Try playing the video using another player, and if it doesn't stutter, then you can simply use that media player from now on. You can try updating or reinstalling the first media player you tried to use and see if that fixes the stuttering issue.

## 2\. Check if You Are Using the Right Display Cable

 If you're using the wrong display cable, it could be that it doesn't support the resolution of the video, causing it to stutter.

 For example, if you tried playing a 4K video at 60Hz using an HDMI 1.4 cable, there's a high chance you'll experience stutter compared to using an HDMI 2.0 cable. To fix that, you'll have to purchase a better display cable at your local computer hardware store or online.

## 3\. Scan for Hardware Changes on Your Computer

 If your graphics hardware encounters a glitch or somehow becomes misconfigured, it can lead to the video stuttering problem. To fix that, you can use the Device Manager to scan for and fix any hardware changes that might have occurred.

 Follow these steps to proceed:

1. Press **Win + R** to open Windows Run.
2. In the text box, enter **devmgmt.msc** and hit the **Enter** key to open Device Manager.  
![devmgmt.msc in Run](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/devmgmt-msc.jpg)
3. In the top menu, click **Action** and select **Scan for hardware changes**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Once the Device Manager finishes the scan, try and play the video again and see if the stuttering persists or not.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Update Your Graphics Driver

 If scanning for hardware changes didn't fix things, then you can try updating the graphics driver while you still have the Device Manager open. If you don't know how to do this, then you can learn [how to find and replace outdated drivers on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/find-replace-outdated-windows-drivers/).

 Make sure you update your display drivers and that the graphics drivers have all the necessary performance improvements and fixes to run the video smoothly.

## 5\. Close Any Resource-Intensive Applications

 Some Windows applications are resource intensive, meaning they require a significant amount of systems resources to run properly. For example, if you're playing a modern 3D game on your computer, Windows would have to dedicate a large chunk of the CPU and GPU resources to ensure that you have a smooth gaming experience.

 So, if you try to play a high-quality video alongside this app, it might end up stuttering due to a lack of free resources. Try closing any resource-intensive application that you're running before playing the video.

## 6\. Run the Video Playback Troubleshooter

 Windows has a built-in tool for diagnosing and fixing issues with video playback. It's called the Video Playback troubleshooter, and it will search for problems affecting video playback on your computer, including driver issues, missing codecs, and misconfigured display and resolution settings.

 To run the Video Playback Troubleshooter on Windows 11, follow the steps below:

1. Press **Win + I** to open Settings and select **System > Troubleshoot**.  
![Troubleshoot option in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/troubleshoot-option.jpg)
2. Select **Other trouble-shooters**.

 Now you can use the tool to fix your video playback issues. If it can fix the issue, it will do it for you, but if it can't, it will offer possible solutions.

## 7\. Change the Windows Graphics Preference Option to High Performance

 Sometimes, the video could be stuttering because the current GPU you're using cannot handle it, which is usually the case for integrated GPUs. If you have a dedicated GPU, you can set that as your preferred choice for the video player.

 To do that on Windows 11, follow the steps below:

1. Press **Win + I** to open Settings, and select **System > Display**.
2. In the **Related settings** section, click on **Graphics**.  
![Go to the Graphics page in Windows settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/go-to-graphics-in-windows-settings.jpg)
3. Click on the video player you're using to expand it and click **Options**.  
![VLC graphics preference options in Windows 11 settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/vlc-graphics-options-in-windows-settings.jpg)
4. In the pop-up, click the **High performance** radio button, which will select the better GPU for your computer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![changing graphics preference on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/changing-graphics-preference-on-windows.jpg)
5. Click **Save** to apply the changes and close the pop-up.

 If you're on Windows 10, follow the steps below:

1. Press **Win + I** to open Settings, select **System > Display**, and then click on the **Graphics settings** link.  
![the Display page in Windows 10 settings](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/the-display-page-in-windows-10-settings.jpg)
2. Click on the video player you're using to expand it and click **Options**.
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/924299/11305" target="_top" id="924299"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-924299" border="0" alt="" width="520" height="100"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. In the pop-up, click the **High performance** radio button, which will select the better GPU for your computer.
4. Click **Save** to apply the changes and close the pop-up.

 Hopefully, with the graphics priority set to the high-performance option, your video stuttering issues will disappear.

## 8\. Change the Number of Allocated GPU Processors

 Dedicating more processing power to the video player could potentially stop the video from stuttering. So, whether you're using VLC or DivX media player, you can learn [how to allocate more CPU cores to Windows applications](http://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-manually-allocate-cpu-cores-windows-10/) to fix the issue.

 We recommend that you choose as many processors as possible by ticking the **All processors** checkbox.

## 9\. Update Windows

 Since a Windows update typically includes performance enhancements and bug fixes, it could also fix the stuttering problem when it comes to videos.

 If you've turned off automatic updates on your computer, there are [ways for you to update Windows manually](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/). And if you're running into problems with the updating process, you can learn [how to fix Windows Update when it's not working](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-update-not-working-windows-pc/).
