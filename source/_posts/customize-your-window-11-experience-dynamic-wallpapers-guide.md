## Customize Your Window 11 Experience: Dynamic Wallpapers Guide

 Live wallpapers are Windows desktop backgrounds that have motion. More basic live wallpapers are typically MP4 video or animated GIF files. A live wallpaper that moves looks more alive than static Windows background images.

 Windows doesn’t have any built-in option for setting videos, or any animated file format, to be live desktop wallpaper. However, Lively Wallpaper is one of numerous third-party apps with which you can add moving wallpapers to Windows 11’s desktop. This is how you can liven up the Windows 11 desktop with Lively Wallpaper.

## How to Add an Interactive Live Wallpaper From Lively Wallpaper’s Library

 Lively Wallpaper is an open-source UWP app that’s available on the Microsoft Store. This app enables you to add 12 premade live wallpapers to the desktop from its library and video files saved on your desktop. The live wallpapers available in this app’s library are a little different from standard videos because they add interactive backgrounds.

 As Lively Wallpaper is a UWP app, the installation required is quick and simple. To install the app, open this [Lively Wallpaper page](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/lively-wallpaper/9NTM2QC6QWS7) and click **Get in Store** \> **Open in Microsoft Store** to [bring up the Microsoft Store app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-microsoft-store/). Then select **Get** to download and install Lively Wallpaper. You can click **Open** on Lively Wallpaper’s MS Store page to launch the app.

 Now you’ll see 12 live wallpaper thumbnail previews on the Lively Wallpaper’s **Library** tab after opening the app. Click a live wallpaper thumbnail on that tab to set the background. The live wallpaper selected will then replace the one on your desktop.

 What sets these premade wallpapers apart from others is that they’re interactive. For example, select the **Fluids** background to see what it’s like. That wallpaper applies a stunning multi-colored fluid effect that reacts to the movement of your mouse cursor. You control the fluid effect by moving your cursor and windows across the desktop.

 Or you can add a jellyfish to your desktop’s background by selecting the Medusae wallpaper. That’s a jellyfish you can rotate by left-clicking on it and holding the mouse button.
