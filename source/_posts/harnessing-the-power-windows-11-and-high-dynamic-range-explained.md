## Harnessing the Power: Windows 11 and High Dynamic Range Explained

 Do you want to enhance the visual experience of your Windows PC? One way to do that is by enabling the HDR option. But what exactly is HDR, and how to enable it?

 This article will discuss HDR and how to enable it on Windows. We'll also explore different fixes that can be useful if HDR isn't working on Windows 11\.

## What Is HDR?

 HDR, or High Dynamic Range, is the new standard for images and videos. It provides proper exposure to images that were previously not possible with Standard Dynamic Range (SDR). This means that an HDR-enabled monitor can show more details in both the dark and bright parts of an image, ultimately enhancing the viewing experience.

 HDR uses higher bit depth to produce more colors on the display. It also increases the peak brightness, which allows for brighter highlights. HDR first became popular among photographers who wanted to properly expose a composition with two subjects having a 13-stop difference in value. But now, it's being used to produce movies, videos, and even games.

## How to Check if Your Computer Supports HDR

 HDR-enabled monitors are the go-to option for media-based tasks, whether you're editing photos or using [the best video editing apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/best-free-video-editing-software/). This is because of their accurate color production quality, meaning you can be more confident that the end product will look close to what you see on the screen.

 However, not all monitors support HDR. You can check if your monitor supports HDR by following these steps:

1. Press **Win + I** to open the Settings app.
2. Select **System** from the left sidebar and **Display** from the right pane.
3. Click **Use HDR**.
4. Click the drop-down icon next to **Display capabilities.**
5. If **HDR video streaming** and **Use HDR** says **Supported,** your display supports HDR.

 Now that you know if your monitor supports HDR or not, let's check out how to enable it.

 If you are using multiple displays, you can choose between the **Use HDR on all displays** and **Use HDR on main display only** options.

 You can also check the **Use Auto HDR with supported games** box, which will configure Windows to automatically enable HDR in games that support it.

## 2\. Enable HDR Using the Settings App

 Another quick way to activate HDR on Windows 11 is through the Windows Settings app. Launch the Settings app, choose **System** from the left sidebar, and **Display** from the right pane. Then, enable the toggle next to **Use HDR** to activate HDR on your monitor.

![Use HDR option in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/use-hdr-option.jpg)

 You can also [enable Auto HDR](https://www.makeuseof.com/sir-how-to-use-windows-11-auto-hdr/) to enhance the picture quality of eligible games from SDR to HDR.

## Why Is HDR Not Working on Windows 11?

 Even if you have enabled HDR, you might notice that it is not working on your Windows PC. This can happen for various reasons, but some of the most common ones are listed below:

* A bug in your Windows version can prevent you from using the HDR feature.
* HDR may not work if your graphics driver is corrupt or outdated.
* You can only enjoy HDR content if your display is connected to your PC using a HDMI 2.0 or DisplayPort 1.4 cable.

 Fortunately, it is very easy to troubleshoot this issue and continue using HDR. Here are all the solutions you can try if HDR is not working on Windows 11\.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 The first course of action to troubleshoot any Windows issue is to restart your computer. This will help to eliminate any temporary bugs or glitches that may be interfering with the HDR feature and preventing it from working on your computer.

 To restart, press **Alt + F4**, choose **Restart** from the drop-down menu, and click **OK.**

 After your computer restarts, check if the HDR feature is working. If not, try the next solution on the list.

## 2\. Eliminate Any Compatibility Issues

 You will not be able to use HDR if you are using an unsupported cable to connect your display to your PC. To use HDR, you must use DisplayPort 1.4 or HDMI 2.0 or higher. You must also ensure that your monitor supports HDR10 and has a resolution of 1080p.

 If either of these requirements is not met, HDR will not work. In this case, the only solution is to upgrade your hardware.

## 3\. Update Your Graphics Driver

 The best way to keep your computer free from graphics-related issues is to regularly download the graphics driver update. To update your graphics driver, launch the Settings app, choose **Windows Update** from the left sidebar, and click on the **Check for updates** option in the right pane.

![Check for updates option in the Settings app](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/check-for-updates-1.jpg)

 Windows will now look for any available updates for all the installed components, including the graphics driver. If it finds any, it will automatically download and install them without much user input.

 Alternatively, you can visit your graphics driver manufacturer's website to download any available updates for your graphics driver.

* [Download Intel Drivers](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)
* [Download AMD Drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
* [Download Nvidia Drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us)

 Upon successfully updating the graphics driver, restart your computer and check if can use HDR.
