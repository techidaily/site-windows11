## Revolutionizing UI: Adding CLI Functionality to TaskMgr in Win11

 The Task Manager is an important Windows tool that allows you to manage apps and processes running in the background. It provides valuable insights into CPU, memory, disk, network, and GPU usage by various applications and processes. However, by default, it does not display the command line used by these processes.

 If you wish to view the command line in the Task Manager, you've come to the right place. This article provides step-by-step instructions on how to add the command line tab to the Windows 11 Task Manager.

## Why You Should Add a Command Line Tab to the Task Manager

 The Processes tab in Task Manager displays a list of all running processes. However, by default, it does not show the command line arguments used by those processes.

 Accessing the command line arguments can be essential for eliminating issues. For instance, if you're trying to [fix a high CPU usage on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-high-cpu-usage-windows/), you can examine the command line arguments to check the command used to initiate a CPU-hungry process.

 Additionally, malware often exploits command-line arguments to spread throughout a computer. By inspecting the command line tab in Task Manager, you can identify processes using suspicious command line arguments.
