## Boost Productivity with Permanent Windows Terminal Admin Entry

 Windows Terminal is an incredibly powerful tool for managing and configuring the computer system. With it, users can execute commands and scripts to accomplish tasks faster than ever before. However, if you're new to using the Terminal, making sure it always opens as an administrator can be tricky.

 In this article, we'll show you how to set up Windows Terminal so that it always launches with administrative rights. This will ensure your commands are executed correctly and provide extra protection against malicious activities on your computer.

## What Makes the Windows Terminal So Important?

 Windows Terminal is a modern, feature-rich application designed to easily access command line tools and shells like PowerShell, CMD, and Azure Cloud Shell. It provides a simple, easy-to-use interface that allows you to access and execute commands faster than ever before.

 Not only that, but you can [change the terminal theme on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-change-terminal-theme/) so it better suits your tastes. You can even group multiple tabs together, so you can run different shells in one window. For these reasons and more, Windows Terminal is an indispensable addition to any computer setup.

## 1\. How to Always Open the Windows Terminal as Administrator Using Settings

 The first method is to adjust the Settings within Windows Terminal itself. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on**Start** and select**Terminal** from the power user menu.
2. Then click the down arrow in the top-left corner and select**Settings** .
3. On the left side of the screen, select**Defaults** from the Profile section. This will open up a new window where you can view all your current configuration options.
4. A**Run this profile as administrator** option can be found on the right side of the page. Click on the toggle switch to enable it.
