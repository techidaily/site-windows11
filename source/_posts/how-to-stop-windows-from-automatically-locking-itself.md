## Why Is Windows 10 Automatically Locking Itself?

 Windows automatically locks itself for one simple reason: to protect your privacy.

 Imagine a scenario where you have to leave your computer unattended for an extended period. If there is no auto-lock on Windows, anyone can use your PC for any reason without any repercussions.

 By locking itself automatically once your PC goes into sleep mode, Windows ensures that your data stays private and nobody except you has access to your computer.
