## Resetting & Restoring Sync in the Microsoft To-Do Application

 Is the Microsoft To Do app not syncing? There could be several reasons behind this issue. Maybe you’re running an outdated app version, you’ve encountered an app bug or glitch, or there’s an authenticating issue, among other possible causes.

 Either way, you shouldn’t let Microsoft To Do syncing issues affect your productivity. Here's how to fix it.

## 1\. Check the Microsoft To Do Server Status

 There’s a chance there’s nothing wrong with the app, but Microsoft is doing some maintenance or troubleshooting work on its servers. Which is why Microsoft To Do isn’t syncing.

 You can check the servers’ status by heading to the [Microsoft Service Status webpage](https://admin.microsoft.com/servicestatus). If there’s an issue with Microsoft To Do, you’ll have to wait until they fix it.

 Also, [check the internet connection on your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-stability-internet-connection-windows/) as an unstable connection will stop Microsoft To Do from syncing.

## 2\. Restart the App

 Whenever you’re dealing with a problematic app, the first thing you should do is restart it. The issue might be a temporary glitch or a malfunctioning process that stops Microsoft To Do from syncing.

 Close Microsoft To Do and press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to bring up the Task Manager. There, right-click the app and select **End task**. This way, you stop any background process from running, and you’ll have a fresh start when you relaunch the app.

## 5\. Let the App Run in the Background

 On Windows, apps can keep running their processes even if you’re not actively in the app’s window. These background apps can stay notified, keep data synchronized, and update themselves. If you’ve changed the app’s settings and [stopped it from running in the background in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-background-apps/), Microsoft To Do will not sync unless you’re actively using it.

 Here’s how you can allow it to run in the background:

1. Press **Windows key + I** to go to Windows Settings.
2. Head to **Apps > Installed apps**.
3. Find **Microsoft To Do** and click the **three-dot** icon next to it.
4. Select **Advanced options**.
