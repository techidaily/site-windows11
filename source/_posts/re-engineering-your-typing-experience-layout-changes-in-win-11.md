1. On the **Language & Region** page in Settings (step #1 above), click **Add a Language**.
2. In the pop-up, select the language you want to install and click **Next**.  
![Selecting a language to install on Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/choose-language-install-windows.jpg)
3. Click **Install** for Windows 11 to download and install the new language.
