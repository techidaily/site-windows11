## Advanced Notetaking for Windows Professionals (Win11/W10)

 You can add notes to the Windows 11/10 desktop with Sticky Notes. However, you can't add any notes to software windows with that accessory. That's a pity since such a feature would enable you to stick all kinds of instructional and hotkey notes for apps to their windows, not to mention task reminders, etc.

 However, Stick A Note and Notezilla are two third-party apps with which you can stick notes to software windows, which we'll look at here.

## How to Add Sticky Notes to Software Windows With Stick a Note

 Stick A Note is a freeware and portable note-taking software for Windows 11 and Windows 10 from the talented solo developer Anand Gupta. By pressing that app's hotkey, you can add a note to any software window you wish. Follow these steps to get stuck in with Stick A Note:

1. First, open the[Stick A Note](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Office-tools/Diary-Organizers-Calendar/Stick-A-Note.shtml) Softpedia page.
2. Select Softpedia's**Download Now** and**Secure Download (US)** options.
3. [Bring up Windows 11's Explorer file manager](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) from the taskbar by clicking its folder library icon.
4. Navigate to the folder the Stick A Note ZIP file downloaded in.
5. Extract the downloaded**Stick A Note 3.0.1 (1).zip** archive. Our[how-to unzip files in Windows 10 guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/unzip-files-windows-10/) includes instructions for extracting ZIPs.

1. Double-click**Stick A Note.exe** in that software's extracted folder.
2. Next, double-click the**Stick A Note** system tray icon.
3. Click the**Settings** button on the app's window.  
![Stick a Note's Settings button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/stick-a-note-s-settings-button.jpg)
4. Select the**Shift** checkbox to change Stick A Note's hotkey to**Win** +**Shift** +**N** . This is necessary because Windows 11 already has a**Win** +**N** keyboard shortcut for notifications that matches this software's default hotkey.  
![The Note Hotkey option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/note-hotkey-option.jpg)
5. Click**OK** on the Settings â€“ Stick A Note window.

1. Open a software window to stick a note.
2. Press the**Win** +**Shift** +**N** hotkey to add a note to the window.
3. Click the sticky note and select**Edit Note** .
4. Enter the content in the**Note for this window** box.

5. Select**OK** in the Notes window.

 Or you can set Stick A Note to automatically show notes after opening software windows. To do so, right-click the program's system tray icon and select**Settings** . Select the**Auto Show Note for the Active Program** checkbox, and click the**OK** option.

 To remove a note, click the**Edit** option in it; press the**Delete** button on the editing window. Select**Yes** on the dialogue box asks to confirm the note's deletion.

 Stick A Note is a little short on formatting options. For instance, you can't apply bold or italic formatting to a note's text. Nor are there any font selection or size options.

 However, you can at least change the color and size of the notes. To do that, right-click the**Stick a Note** system tray icon and select**Settings** \>**Note Settings** ; choose an alternative option on the**Note Color** drop-down menu. Enter values up to**600** in the size boxes to resize the notes.

 Notezilla also enables you to stick notes to specific files open in software packages. Bring up a word processor, spreadsheet, or any other application with which you can open document files. Open a file within the application. Stick a note to the software's window, as outlined for steps eight to 14 above. Select the checkbox for the file in the window and click**OK** . Then you'll only see the note in the software's window when you bring up the file you stuck it on.

![A sticky note for a file](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/a-sticky-note-for-a-file.jpg)

 Or you can stick a note to a webpage instead. Open a page in a web browser. Then drag the note onto the webpage, and select the**Stick to window** option. Select the checkbox for the page tab in the browser.

 To check out Notezilla's formatting options, double-click inside the note to add some content. Then right-click in the text box ao bring up a formatting context menu. There you can select different fonts and adjust the text size and color.
