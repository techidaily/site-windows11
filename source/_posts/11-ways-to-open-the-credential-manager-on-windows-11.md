## 11 Ways to Open the Credential Manager on Windows 11

 Credential Manager in Windows 11 stores all the username and password combinations that you use for websites you visit in Edge browsers, apps, or networks. Microsoft introduced Credential Manager with Windows 10 and since then it stores and manages all credentials in one place. You can even back up and remove credential entries that are obsolete.

 The most obvious method to access the Credential Manager is using the Control Panel. But do you know that there are other methods to access this password management too? We will list out all the possible ways to open it quickly. Let’s begin.

1. Press**Win + E** to [launch the File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-open-file-explorer/) .

4. Select**Show more options** from the context menu and then click on the**Open with** option.
5. Scroll down and click on the**Choose an app on your PC** option.
6. Navigate to the C drive and click on the Windows folder. Then, open the SysWOW64 folder.

8. Window Control Panel will be added to the list of supported programs.**Double-click** on it to open keymgr.dll file in Control Panel.

2. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** to launch Command Prompt with administrator privileges.
3. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press the**Enter** key:**control.exe keymgr.dll**

## 6\. Using Control Panel

 Control Panel is the central hub for many system utilities and also contains Credential Manager. If you prefer the GUI method to open any Windows utility, you can use Control Panel. Repeat the following steps:

1. Press**Win + R** to launch the Run command box. Type**control** and press the**Enter** key.
2. In the Control Panel window, click on the**User Accounts** option.

## 7\. Using a Desktop Shortcut

 A desktop shortcut can save much time in Credential Manager on the system. Since it is not an executable program but a DLL file, merely making a desktop shortcut won’t work. Instead, we will create a shortcut of the Credential Manager DLL file and configure it to open with Control Panel.

 Repeat the following steps to create a shortcut for Credential Manager:

1. Press**Win + D** to switch to Desktop.
2. Right-click on the Desktop and select the**New > Shortcut** option from the context menu.
3. In the Create Shortcut window, paste the following text in the Location box:**control.exe /name Microsoft.CredentialManager**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Open Credentials Manager Using a Desktop Shortcut](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/open-credentials-manager-using-a-desktop-shortcut.jpg)
4. Click on the**Next** button. Name the shortcut**Credential Manager** and click on the**Finish** button.
5. Now, double-click on the shortcut to open Credential Manager.

## 8\. Using the Settings App

 Microsoft hasn’t moved all Control Panel options to the Settings app. But it is possible to search and access Credential Manager inside the Settings app. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Right-click** on the Start button to open the Power User menu. Select the**Settings** option from the menu.
2. Navigate to the top-left corner and click on the**Find a setting** option.

## 9\. Using a PowerShell Command

2. Type**PowerShell** and click on the**Run as administrator** option in the right pane.

4. Credential Manager will open. Type the**exit** command in the PowerShell window and press the**Enter** key to close it.

## 10\. Using a Batch File

 A batch file is a more convenient method to open Credential Manager whenever you need it. You can place it on the desktop and run it with administrator privileges just like a shortcut. Repeat the following steps to create a batch file:

1. Press**Win + D** to switch to the Desktop. Right-click on the desktop and select the**New > Text Document** option.
2. Open the empty text document and paste the following code snippet:  
`@echo off powershell.exe control.exe keymgr.dll`
3. Press**Ctrl + Shift + S** to open the**Save as** window. Name the file “**CredMgr.bat** ” and click on the**Save** button.
