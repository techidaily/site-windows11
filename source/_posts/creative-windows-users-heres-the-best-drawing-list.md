## Creative Windows Users, Here’s the Best Drawing List

 If you are a professional artist or just a beginner wanting to begin your manga series, there are so many digital drawing apps available that it's easy to become overwhelmed. As such, we have picked out some of the best drawing apps for Windows 10 so that you know exactly what you need.

 Let's see what each app offers and which one fits your needs the best.

## 1\. Krita

 Whether you are a professional artist or an amateur, Krita is the software to choose if you don't want to spend money on drawing tools. The program supports the value of flexibility in the creative process, which is why it provides a flexible interface and customizable panels that you can set to your liking.

 The official website is the only place where you can download the Krita app for free. Unfortunately, Krita is no longer a free download on Microsoft Store.

 The stabilization tool helps keep lines smooth without any bumps or shakes. And for a change of style in your sketching, you can import free brush packs from the Krita community and mix up the tools you have at your disposal. Who knows, you might even find textures and patterns that fit you perfectly.

**Download:** [Krita](https://krita.org/en/download/krita-desktop/) (Free, Paid)
