## Correcting Unopened Sharing Errors with GeForce Experience

 The NVIDIA GeForce Experience app uses an overlay where you can share your greatest gaming moments by capturing screenshots and recording gameplay. However, some users can’t share their gameplay with that overlay because of an “unable to open share” error. That error message sometimes appears when users click the **Open in-game overlay** option in GeForce Experience.

 The “unable to open share” error means the GeForce Experience overlay doesn’t work when users try to activate it. GeForce Experience users can’t capture and share gaming moments without that overlay. Here is how you can fix the “unable to open share” error.

## 1\. Run NVIDIA Share With Admin Rights and Terminate NVIDIA Processes

 Many GeForce Experience users have resolved the “Unable to open share” error by running NVIDIA Share with admin rights. Those users also terminated background NVIDIA processes before running Share. To apply this potential fix, run the NVIDIA Share.exe with elevated permissions and terminate background processes as follows:

1. Press **Win + E** and bring up this folder path in File Explorer:  
`C:/Program Files (x86)/NVIDIA Corporation/NVIDIA GeForce Experience`
2. Set the **NVIDIA Share.exe** file in that folder to always run as administrator. Our guide on [always running programs as an administrator on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/always-run-apps-administrator-windows/) includes instructions for setting elevated rights.  
![Run this program as administrator setting](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/run-this-program-as-administrator.jpg)
3. Then activate Task Manager (press **Ctrl** \+ **Shift** \+ **Esc**) and go to the **Processes** tab in that tool.
4. Select an NVIDIA background task and click **End task**.

5. Repeat step four for all NVIDIA background processes shown in Task Manager.
6. Go back to the NVIDIA GeForce Experience folder, right-click **NVIDIA Share.exe**, and select **Run as administrator**.  
![The Run as administrator context menu option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/run-as-administrator-option.jpg)
7. Then select to restart (do not shut down) Windows 11/10\.
8. Return to the **NVIDIA Share.exe** file, right-click it, and select **Run as administrator** again.
9. Launch GeForce Experience to see if the “Unable to open share” error is fixed.

 Note that the above GeForce Experience path specified is a default one for 32-bit software. If you’ve installed GeForce Experience in a different directory, you’ll need to open it from there. For example, the software could also be installed at:

`C:/Program Files/NVIDIA Corporation/NVIDIA GeForce Experience`

## 2\. Download Media Feature Pack for Windows N Versions

 The “Unable to open share” error also occurs when the Windows Media Feature Pack is not installed on users’ PCs. That pack isn’t pre-installed on Windows 11/10 N editions. The GeForce Experience overlay needs that feature. If your PC has a Windows N edition platform, download and install the Media Feature Pack as follows:

1. Start the Settings app by pressing your keyboard’s **Windows** logo + **I** keys simultaneously.
2. Then click on the **Apps** tab.
3. Click **Optional features** to bring up an installed features list.  
![The Optional features navigation option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/optional-features-button.jpg)
4. Press the **View features** button.

5. Input **Media Feature Pack** in the search box to find it.

6. Select the **Next** \> **Install** options.

 The steps for installing the same pack are a little different in Windows 10’s settings app. Click **Apps** \> **Optional features** \> **Add a feature** in Windows 10 Settings. Then input the search phrase to find and install the Media Feature Pack.

### 4\. Temporarily Turn Off Your Antivirus Software

 An antivirus tool on your PC might be blocking GeForce Experience’s share (overlay) feature. So, [try disabling Microsoft Defender](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-off-windows-defender/) or third-party antivirus software installed on your PC before clicking GeForce Experience’s share button.

 To disable a third-party antivirus utility, right-click its icon within the system tray part of the taskbar and select an option that will disable its shield. You may need to click a **Show hidden icon** (arrow) to see the utility’s icon.
