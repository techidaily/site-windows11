## Cross-Language Build System Setup

 When compared to a password, using a PIN provides a faster login experience on Windows. At times, you may want to change the account PIN for various reasons.

 Both Windows 10 and 11 provide a couple of options for changing the account PIN. Let’s go over both methods one by one.

## How to Change the Account PIN Using the Settings App

 The Windows Settings app makes it simple to manage sign-in options on your computer. Here’s how you can use it to change your account PIN on Windows. Note that this method will only work if you know your current PIN.

1. Open the**Start menu** and click the**gear-shaped icon** to launch the Settings app.
2. Use the left sidebar to navigate to the**Accounts** tab.
3. Click on**Sign-in options** in the right pane.
4. Click**PIN (Windows Hello)** to expand it.
5. Click the**Change PIN** button.
6. In the Windows Security window that appears, enter your current PIN followed by your new PIN.
7. Click**OK** to save the changes.

 Similarly, the Settings app also gives you the option to change your account password on Windows. If you’re interested in doing that, check our guide on [how to change an account password in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/change-account-password-windows-11/) and follow the steps outlined there.

## How to Change the Account PIN From the Sign-In Screen

 Although the above method lets you change the account PIN in a few easy steps, you may not be able to use it if you don't remember your current PIN. Fortunately, Windows gives you the option to change your computer's PIN from the sign-in screen as well.

 The steps for changing the account PIN from the sign-in screen vary depending on whether you’re using a Microsoft account or a Local account. Here are the steps for both.

### How to Change PIN From the Sign-In Screen If Using a Microsoft Account

If you're using a Microsoft account:

1. On the Windows sign-in screen, click the**I forgot my PIN** option.
2. In the Microsoft account window, enter your password and then click the**Sign in** button.
3. On the following screen, specify whether you want to receive the verification code via email or phone number.
4. Enter your email address or phone number and click the**Send code** button.
5. Type in the received security code and click**Verify** .
6. Once verified, Windows will ask you to confirm the action. Click**Continue** to proceed.
7. Enter your new PIN twice and click**OK** .

### How to Change PIN From the Sign-In Screen If Using a Local Account

If you're using a local account instead:

1. On the Windows sign-in screen, click on**Sign-in options** .
2. Select the**Password** option (key icon) and enter the password associated with your local account.
3. Once you’re signed in, press**Win + I** or use one of [the many ways to open the Settings app](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/) .
4. Navigate to**Accounts > Sign-in options** .
5. Click**PIN (Windows Hello)** to expand it.
6. Click**I forgot my PIN** .
7. In the Windows Security window, enter the password for your account and click**OK** .
8. Set up the new PIN by entering it twice. Then, click**OK** .

 Once you complete the above steps, your account PIN on Windows will be changed. Note that some of your apps might require you to sign in after you reset your account PIN.

 Don’t want to enter a PIN every time you access your computer? Check our guide on [how to set up automatic sign-in on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/automatically-sign-user-in-windows-10/) to avoid the login screen.

## Effortlessly Change Your Windows Account PIN

 As we just saw, changing the account PIN on Windows isn’t too difficult, even if you forget it.

 Alternatively, if your PC has a fingerprint scanner, you can also use Windows Hello fingerprint recognition to log in to your computer by simply scanning your finger on the reader.
