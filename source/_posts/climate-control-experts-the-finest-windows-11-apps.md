## Climate Control Experts: The Finest Windows 11 Apps

 It fetches information from the MSN weather forecast web app. Click on any weather condition to view detailed information on the web app. That said, it is a rudimentary app for those who need to know the temperature for the day and if it will rain.

 To customize the widget, click the three-dots menu and select Customize. Here, you can change the location and switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. You can use Microsoft’s MSN Weather app for Windows if you need more.

 Foreca Weather is a weather forecast app for Windows with a clean UI and many customization options. With automatic location detection, it can show weather forecasts from over an impressive 140000 locations.

 What sets Foreca Weather apart from other apps is the five-day and 10-day weather forecast feature.

But it misses out on humidity, visibility, and Air Quality Index features.

 You can also view a rain and cloud map throughout the day and get precipitation notifications. Add locations to Favorites to [view weather forecasts for multiple locations](https://www.makeuseof.com/news-interests-weather-icon-city/) simultaneously.

 MyRadar may not be as popular amongst Windows users, but it has over 50 million downloads on iOS and Android platforms. It is a weather forecast app that displays animated weather radar for your current location.

 You can select your region or view other parts of the map with scroll-to-zoom. With the region selected, click on the Forecast icon to view the temperature, Air Quality Index, and precipitation forecast at a glance.

 On the flip side, MyRadar is not available in all countries, which may also affect its accuracy. For example, it’ll be more likely to show an accurate weather forecast to someone living in Santa Fe than someone living in India. So, your mileage may vary depending on where you live.

**Download**: [MyRadar](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/myradar/9WZDNCRFHZN6) (Free, premium version available)

 During setup, you can choose the location, weather forecast update frequency, and your preferred temperature measurement unit to set up the app. In the left pane, you can view severe weather alerts, the weather radar, and your favorite locations.

 SimpleWeather works well for the most part, except when it chooses to crash when you try to access the radar feature. It also fails to save your initial setup configuration and requires you to re-do it.

## The Best Weather App for Windows 10 and 11

 Whether planning to run a quick errand or the next family trip, these Windows weather apps can help you check the current conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind, and long-term forecasts to help you plan.

 But a good weather app can do much more. It can give you hurricane or extreme weather alerts and air quality information so that you can plan your outings accordingly. Here are the best weather apps for Windows 10 and 11 to match your purpose and style.
