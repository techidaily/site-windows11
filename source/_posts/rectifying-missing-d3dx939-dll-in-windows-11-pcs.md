 There are a few causes of the D3DX9\_39.dll missing error. It includes incorrect installation of DirectX, a system infection by malicious software, or the file being corrupted for any reason. In most cases, however, it is simply the file being corrupted or missing from its location.

## 1\. Restart Your Computer

 One of the simplest and most often recommended solutions to fix a DirectX-related issue is restarting your computer. It refreshes all processes and resets system memory, which can often solve the issue.

To restart your computer, follow these steps:

1. Save and close any open programs on your computer
2. Now press**Win + R** on your keyboard.
3. In the Run dialog box, type**shutdown /r** and hit Enter.
4. Your computer will restart automatically

 After restarting, try running the application again to see if the error is still present. If you're lucky, your computer will be able to recognize and load the necessary DLL files upon reboot—without any further intervention.

## 2\. Reinstall DirectX

 If restarting your computer doesn't work, you can try installing DirectX to the latest version. Here's how to do it:

1. Go to the[Microsoft DirectX download page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Download/confirmation.aspx?id=35) . This will automatically download the latest version of DirectX for your Windows system.
2. After downloading, press**Win + R** on your keyboard.
3. Type**Downloads** in the text box and hit Enter.
4. Next, double-click on the executable file to install it.
5. When UAC prompts appears on the screen, click**Yes** to continue.

 Once you've reinstalled DirectX on your computer, restart your computer. After that, try running the program that was causing the D3DX9\_39.dll missing error and see if this resolves the issue.

## 3\. Check for Any New Windows Updates

 It is also recommended to check for any Windows updates that may have become available since you initially downloaded and installed DirectX. These updates might feature bug repairs as well as advanced performance improvements, which could assist in resolving your DirectX errors.

 If you're unsure how to update Windows, check out[how to update Windows manually](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-manually/) for instructions.

## 4\. Reinstall the Problematic Program

 If the d3dx9\_39.dll error still persists, it's likely that the application you want to run might be corrupted or improperly installed. To fix this issue, try reinstalling the program and see if it works then. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Control Panel and select**Uninstall a program** .
2. Select the problematic application from the list of installed programs.
3. Click**Uninstall** and select**Yes** in the confirmation box.
4. Restart your computer and reinstall the program from its official site.

 After reinstalling, try running the application to see if it works. If you're still encountering d3dx9\_43.dll is missing errors, continue to the next solution.

## 5\. Repair Corrupted System Files

 If the above steps fail to resolve the d3dx9\_43.dll missing error, it's likely that Windows system files may have been corrupted or damaged, which could be causing the error. To fix this issue, try running the SFC and DISM scan to repair any potential system file damage.
