## Fast Track: Obtaining Adobe Reader From the Microsoft Shop

 We all use PDF files for various needs like school notes, books, resumes, bills, medical reports, investment portfolios, and more. As a business owner or a professional, you might be drafting contracts on PDFs as they are secure and can be signed and verified.

 Adobe Acrobat Reader is the most popular and trusted app for viewing, editing, and creating PDF files. And it's now available for download on the Microsoft Store—making it the best way to get it fast and safely on your Windows 11 PC. Let's explore how.

## What Is Adobe Acrobat Reader DC?

 There's a good chance you know about Adobe Acrobat Reader. Adobe not only invented Adobe Acrobat thirty years ago but also the Portable Document Format or PDF as we call it.

 This paper-to-digital revolution enabled the sharing of text and images digitally while retaining the document's original format. You might have also saved a Word document as a PDF before printing so that the printed result would match your created document.

 Today, Adobe Reader has become the free, trusted global standard for reliably viewing, printing, e-signing, sharing, and annotating PDFs. And the PDF file format, with its size flexibility, portability, quality, and ISO 32000 standards, is trusted by individuals like you and businesses worldwide.

 Adobe Reader lets you interact with all PDF content like an online form. You can also add music and video to PDFs to make a lesson or pitch more engaging. Moreover, you can fill, e-sign, and lock your forms and confidential documents that become invalid if someone tries to edit them.

 Fortunately, you no longer need to search online for this nifty and must-have tool. You can download Adobe Reader on your Windows 11 PC via the default Microsoft Store app.

## Should You Download Adobe Reader?

 Adobe Reader has proven its mettle as an all-in-one solution to work with PDF documents. It also features in our [recommendation of the best PDF readers](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/6-pdf-readers-windows/).

Adobe also offers [Chrome and Edge extensions](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/pdf-viewer-extension.html) for the app, so [you may not need Adobe Reader](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/this-is-why-you-dont-need-adobe-reader/) after all.
