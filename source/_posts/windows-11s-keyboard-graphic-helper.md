## Windows 11'S Keyboard Graphic Helper

 If you're working with text, sooner or later you will need to use special characters.

With this tool, you can create documents or website designs that require symbols or characters not found on a standard keyboard.

 If you would like to access all of these characters, you will need to open up the Character Map application. Here is how to do that in Windows 11.
