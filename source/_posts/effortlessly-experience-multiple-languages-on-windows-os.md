## Effortlessly Experience Multiple Languages on Windows OS

 Sometimes you may need to translate content from foreign websites or documents to your native language; most users probably rely on translation features integrated within Google and Microsoft software. The MS Office apps incorporate a built-in translator feature, and you can utilize cloud-based Microsoft and Google translators in Edge and Chrome.

 However, there are also some good alternative translator tools you can utilize across all Windows software. QTranslate and DeepL are two utilities with which you can translate text by pressing hotkeys. This is how you can add translate text passages with those apps’ hotkeys in Windows 11/10.

## How to Translate Text in Windows Software With QTranslate

 QTranslate is among the[best free translation apps](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-free-translator-apps/) for Windows platforms dating back to XP. It enables you to translate text in all Windows software with nine cloud-based translator services (including Microsoft and Google). However, the best thing about this software is its hotkey functionality for translating selected text. You can translate text passages with QTranslate like this:

1. Open[the QTranslate](http://quest-app.appspot.com/home) website.
2. Click the**Download QTranslate** button.
3. Press File Explorer’s button (the one with a folder library icon) on your taskbar.
4. Go to whatever folder has the QTranslate setup file in it.
5. Double-click the**Qtranslate.6.10.0.exe** installer file.
6. Select the**I Agree** and**Install** options for QTranslate. The software will then automatically start after installation so long as you kept the Run QTranslate checkbox selected.

7. Open a website in a foreign language to try out the translator. For the sake of example, this[German Microsoft Store page](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/store/b/microsoftunddu) will do.
8. Select some text to translate on the website, and press the**Ctrl** +**Q** hotkey. A popup window with an English translation for your selected foreign text will open.  
![The QTranslate popup window for translations](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/qtranslate-popup-window.jpg)

 The popup window that opens includes a few options. You can select different translation services at the bottom of the window. Click the star button to save it to your favorites. Add the translated text to the clipboard by selecting the**Copy selection to clipboard** option.

 You can view the main QTranslate translation window by selecting text and pressing the**Ctrl** key twice. That window displays the selected foreign text alongside the translated content. There you can change the translation by choosing a different language on the drop-down menu and clicking**Translate** . Click the**Listen** **to text** (headphone) buttons to play an audio text-to-speech translation.
