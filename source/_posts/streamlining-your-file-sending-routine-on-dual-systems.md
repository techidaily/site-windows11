## Streamlining Your File Sending Routine on Dual Systems

 Previously, you could only use Google's Nearby Share feature to share files between Android devices and Chromebooks. However, this has changed with Google's release of Nearby Share Beta for Windows. With it, you can seamlessly exchange photos, videos, documents, and more between Android phones and Windows PCs.

 Let's see how you can use Google’s Nearby Share app to transfer files between Android devices and Windows computers.

* Your computer must have a**64-bit version of Windows 10 or up** . ARM-powered Windows devices are not supported at the moment. If you're unsure which version your PC is using, be sure to read[how to tell if your Windows is 32 or 64-bit](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-easy-ways-to-know-if-youre-on-a-64-bit-version-of-windows/) .
* Your Android phone must be running**Android 6.0 or higher** . Not sure which version your phone is on? Check out[how to tell which version of Android you have](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-version-of-android/) and find out.
* Both devices should have**Bluetooth** and**Wi-Fi** turned on.
* Both devices should be connected to the same Wi-Fi network and within**16 feet (5 meters)** of each other.
* Google’s Nearby Share app for Windows is available in most parts of the world except for a few European countries. You can check if your country is supported via[Google Support](https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/13470053) , under "availability."
