## Troubleshooting Windows: 5 Steps for Non-Functional Backlit Keys

 Backlit keyboards don't just look cool, but they make using your computer in low-light environments easier. Instead of hunching over your keyboard or increasing the monitor’s brightness, so you can see what key you’re pressing, you can turn on your keyboard’s backlight.

 However, different apps, software updates, or hardware issues might stop your backlit keyboard from working. So if you’ve already restarted your computer or connected your keyboard to every USB port, and it’s still not working, it’s time you take a closer look at the problem.

## 1\. Check if Your Keyboard Comes With the Backlit Feature

 Even if you’ve bought a new, fancy-looking keyboard, there’s a chance it doesn’t have the backlit feature. The same goes for your laptop. Go to the manufacturer’s website and check the product description for your keyboard or computer. This will save you from looking for an inexistent problem.

![backlit-keyboard-1](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/backlit-keyboard-1.jpg)

 If you’re sure your keyboard comes with a backlight, try using a keyboard shortcut to turn it on. Depending on the manufacturer, the shortcut might be the **Fn key** and one of the **F keys** or **Fn key + Spacebar**.

 If the backlight doesn’t turn on, try the solutions we have listed below. Some of them might be a bit complicated, but we’ll walk you through the steps.

## 2\. Increase the Brightness Level

 There’s a chance you’ve set the brightness level too low, so it doesn’t make a difference after you turn on the keyboard backlight. The fastest way to increase the brightness level is to use your keyboard.

 Look for the key with the backlight icon and press it two or three times in a row. If you’ve found the backlight icon, but it doesn’t work, press the **Fn key** at the same time.

## 3\. Check Your Hardware

 When dealing with a backlit keyboard that’s not working, it might be difficult to figure out if it’s a hardware or software issue. So, before taking a look at your system settings, rule out any problem regarding the hardware.

* Reconnect the keyboard. If it’s a Bluetooth keyboard, turn off Bluetooth for a few moments and turn it back on.
* Plug the keyboard into a different USB port. If its backlit feature is now working, you’ll have to [fix a malfunctioning USB port](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dead-usb-port-heres-how-to-diagnose-and-fix-it/).
* Take a look at the keyboard cable and search for any damage.

## 4\. Check the Keyboard App

 If your laptop has a built-in backlit keyboard, check its app. Most of the time, the app will get installed at the same time as the keyboard drivers, but this may vary, depending on the manufacturer.

 Also, if you’ve connected an external keyboard that comes with the backlit feature, you should take a look at the app. Check the keyboard settings within the app and make sure everything is as you want. Also, go to the producer’s website and update the app to the latest version.

 Even if you’ve made the right system settings, a third-party keyboard app may overwrite them, so it’s worth checking it out.

## 5\. Update Your Keyboard Drivers

 If your keyboard backlight is sensor-activated, and it doesn’t work anymore, there’s a chance an outdated or corrupt driver is causing the problem. To fix it, you should update your keyboard driver. Here is how you can do it:

1. Right-click **Start > Device manager**.
2. Expand the **Keyboard** menu.
3. Right-click your keyboard driver and select **Update driver**.

## 6\. Run the Keyboard Troubleshooter

 If updating the driver didn’t fix your backlit keyboard, Windows comes with a couple of built-in troubleshooting tools that you can use.

1. Press **Win + I** to open Windows Settings.
2. Select **Update & Security** and head to **Troubleshoot >** **Additional troubleshooters**.
3. From **Find and fix other problems**, select **Keyboard > Run the troubleshooter**.

 In Windows 11, go to **Settings > System >Troubleshoot > Other trouble-shooters** to access the Keyboard troubleshooter.

 Once Windows finishes the troubleshooting process, try to turn on or adjust the brightness of your backlit keyboard. If it didn’t work, there is another troubleshooter you should run. While Microsoft removed it from the Settings menu, you can still access it using a Command Prompt line.

 Follow these steps to run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter:

1. Open Command Prompt with administrative rights.
2. Type **msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic** and press **Enter**.
3. In the **Hardware and Devices** window, click **Advanced** and check **Apply repairs automatically**.
4. Click **Next** to run the troubleshooter.

## 7\. Perform a Clean Boot

 If nothing worked until now, you should [perform a clean boot](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-perform-clean-boot-windows-10/)on your computer. This way, your system will start without any third-party app that might influence your backlit keyboard functionality. If your keyboard lights up, open Control Panel and take a look at the apps that you’ve installed lately since one of them is causing your problem.
