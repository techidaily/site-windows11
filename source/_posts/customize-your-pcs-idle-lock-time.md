## How to Keep Your Windows PC Inaccessible While Your Gone

 There are lots of places you could use a PC or laptop. It could be in the office, at a conference venue, or on the go at your favorite café. And there'll be times you just need to get up to attend to something pressing.

 Fortunately, you can set your PC to lock automatically after a custom amount of time without activity. This means you can safely leave your work desk, knowing your work is safe from prying eyes.

 Of course, you can also lock your PC manually when you walk away from it—just press the**Win + L** keys together or**Ctrl + Alt + Del** and then sign out. But you could miss doing that in a rush, or if you're distracted.

 Instead, check out these methods to configure your Windows PC to lock automatically when there is no activity after a specific amount of time.

## 1\. How to Lock Your Windows PC After a Set Time via the Local Security Policy

 Using the Local Security Policy, you can set the exact time in seconds after which your PC will lock itself automatically. Make sure you're signed in as an administrator to automatically lock your PC.

 Local Security Policy is only available in the Windows 10 and 11 Pro, Education, and Enterprise editions. If you're using the Home version, skip to method two.

1. Type**Local Security Policy** in Windows Search. Click the**Local Security Policy** under**Best match** to open it. Alternatively, press the**Win + R** keys together to open the**Run** box. Type**secpol.msc** in the**Open** navigation bar and click**OK** or hit**Enter** to launch it.  
![Open Local Security Policy via Run](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/open-local-security-policy-via-run.jpg)
2. Click the down arrow next to**Local Policies** in the left pane to expand it.
3. Click on**Security Options** to open it.
4. The Security Options will open up in the right pane. Now scroll down to the policy named**Interactive logon: Machine inactivity limit** and double-click on it to open its properties.  
![Machine Inactivity Limit Selected in Security Options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/select-machine-inactivity-limit-in-security-options.jpg)
5. Under the section**Machine will be locked after** , enter the time in seconds after which you want your PC to get locked automatically. This time is the time of machine inactivity or the time when your PC is idle. You can enter the time between**0** to**599940** seconds. For this tutorial, we'll enter**300 seconds** which is five minutes. Now click on**Apply** and then**OK** .
6. Finally, close the Local Security Policy window and restart your computer for the change to take effect.

 Now, when you use your PC, you will experience that your PC will lock itself after your custom timer expires. And if someone tries to unlock your PC while you're gone, it'll ask them for your password, which should keep them at bay until you get back.

 If you ever want to reverse this action and not have your PC lock automatically, just open the**Interactive logon: Machine inactivity limit** policy in**Local Security Policy** . Then just change the time or seconds to**0** —this is the default setting and will not lock your PC automatically.

## 2\. How to Lock Your Windows PC After a Specific Amount of Inactivity via the Registry Editor

 You can tweak settings in the Registry Editor to configure your PC to lock automatically after a set time. And you can do this in Windows Home and all the other Windows editions.

 However, you must be careful while making changes in the registry and should only make the changes as detailed below and not change anything else. It'd be a good idea to create a restore point in Windows before you change your registry settings. If something goes wrong, you can revert your PC to its last working state.

 Now let's go ahead and explore how to lock your PC automatically via the Registry Editor.

1. Type**Registry Editor** in**Windows Search** and select**Registry Editor** under**Best match** . Or use one of the many [ways to open the Registry Editor in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-registry-editor/) .
2. Click on**Yes** on the UAC prompt.
3. In the left pane, use the following path to reach the**System** registry key: **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System**

4. Click on the**System** key in the left pane and its components will open up in the right pane. Now scroll down to get to the**InactivityTimeoutSecs** DWORD.  
![Scroll to InactivityTimeoutSecs in System Key](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/scroll-to-inactivitytimeoutsecs.jpg)
5. Double-click on the**InactivityTimeoutSecs** DWORD to modify its value. Select**Decimal** under**Base** , and under**Value data** , enter a number between**0** to**599940** —this is the time in seconds after which your PC will get locked automatically. Like in the Local Security Policy method, we'll give it a time of**300 seconds** or five minutes. Now tap on**OK** .
6. In case you do not find the**InactivityTimeoutSecs** DWORD in your registry, you can create it. Right-click on the**System** key folder in the left pane or right-click on a space in the right pane of the**System** key. Select**New** , then select**DWORD (32-bit) Value** .
