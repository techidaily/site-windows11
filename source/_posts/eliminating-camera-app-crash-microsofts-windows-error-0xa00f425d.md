## Eliminating Camera App Crash: Microsoft's Windows Error 0xA00F425D

 Windows' error 0xA00F425D is an issue users have reported occurs when trying to use their webcams with the Camera app. Users have said that error happens when clicking Camera’s Record button. That error message says, “Sorry, something went wrong… 0xA00F425D <VideoCaptureStartFailed> (0x80131500).”

 As a result, users can’t capture video with the Camera app. Error 0xA00F425D has mostly been reported to happen on Windows 10, but that app error can also arise in 11\. This is how to fix error 0xA00F425D in Windows 10 and 11 if you need to resolve this issue.

## 1\. Run the Camera and Recording Audio Troubleshooters

 Windows includes two troubleshooters that can feasibly resolve error 0xA00F425D. The camera troubleshooter specifically addresses webcam issues. Users who’ve fixed error 0xA00F425D have also found running the recording audio troubleshooter can resolve this issue.

This is how you can run those troubleshooters in Windows 10 and 11:

1. Bring up Settings, and select that app’s**System** tab.
2. Select the**Troubleshoot** \>**Other trouble-shooters** navigation options.  
![The Troubleshoot navigation option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/troubleshoot-option.jpg)
3. Click**Run** for the Camera troubleshooter.  
![The Run Camera troubleshooter option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/camera-troubleshooter.jpg)
4. Then click**Yes** in the**Get help** window to apply automated troubleshooting.  
![The Camera troubleshooting window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/camera-troubleshooter-window.jpg)
5. If the Camera troubleshooter doesn’t help much, try selecting**Run** for the Recording Audio troubleshooter.
6. Select your PC’s microphone device in the troubleshooter.  
![A Recording Audio troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/recording-audio-troubleshooter.jpg)
7. Press**Next** to apply the troubleshooting.

 Accessing troubleshooters in Windows 10 isn’t quite the same. Select**Update & Security** and Troubleshooter in Windows 10’s Settings app. Then click**Additional troubleshooter** to bring up the window from which you can open the tools. Note that Windows 10 also has an alternative**Speech** troubleshooter that can also resolve microphone issues.

## 2\. Enable Your PC’s Microphone

 Enabling the microphone is a confirmed solution for error 0xA00F425D. Running the Recording Audio troubleshooter might detect and enable a disabled microphone on your PC. However, you can manually enable your PC’s microphone as follows:

1. First, bring up**Device Manager** , which you can select to open from the Power User menu by pressing the**Windows** logo +**X** key combination.
2. Then double-click**Audio inputs and outputs** to view all devices associated with that category.  
![The Audio inputs and output category](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/audio-inputs-and-outputs.jpg)
3. Right-click your PC’s device and select**Enable device** if it’s disabled.  
![The Enable device option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/enable-device-option.jpg)
4. Press**Windows** logo +**I** to go into Settings, and select**Privacy** there.
5. Click**Microphone** to access settings for that device.
6. Turn on the**Microphone access** (or**Allow apps to access your Microphone**) option.  
![The Microphone access option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/microphone-access-option.jpg)
7. Then toggle on the**Camera** option to enable microphone access for that app.

## 3\. Plug an External Webcam Into an Alternative USB Port

 This potential error 0xA00F425D fix is for users who utilize external webcams with the Camera app. Some people have said they resolved error 0xA00F425D by plugging their external webcams into an alternative USB 2.0 port on their PCs. It's worth a try if you use an external camera for recording.

## 4\. Edit the Registry’s Platform Keys

 Users have also been able to get error 0xA00F425D fixed by editing two different Platform keys in the registry. This registry solution involves creating new EnableFrameServerMode DWORDs for those keys. You can apply that registry tweak within Windows 10 and 11 in the following steps:

1. Click the search box (or magnifying glass) on your taskbar.
2. Type**Registry Editor** inside your search box to find that app.
3. Click**Registry Editor** to open its window.
4. Then input this**Platform** key path into Registry Editor’s address bar and press**Enter** :  
`Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Media Foundation\Platform`
5. Right-click**Platform** in the left sidebar to select the**New** submenu.

1. Select**DWORD (32-bit) Value** option and input**EnableFrameServerMode** for the name.  
![The DWORD (32-bit) Value option](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/dword-option.jpg)
2. Double-click the**EnableFrameServerMode** DWORD you’ve just added.
3. The**EnableFrameServerMode’s** value might be set to**0** by default. If it isn’t, however, input**0** in the data box to set that value.  
![The Edit DWORD window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/edit-dword-option.jpg)
4. Exit the Edit DWORD window by clicking**OK** .
5. Erase the current registry location in the address bar, and input the following alternative path there:  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows Media Foundation\Platform`  
![A Platform key](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/enableframeserver-dword.jpg)
6. Repeat steps six to 10 for the second**Platform** key.

## 5\. Update Your Webcam’s Driver

 Another possible reason for error 0xA00F425D occurring is that your webcam’s driver is outmoded or faulty. You can check if your webcam’s driver is outdated or corrupted by running a scan with Driver Booster or alternatives. Our guide on [how to update your drivers using Driver Booster](https://www.makeuseof.com/update-windows-drivers-driver-booster-8/) tells you how to utilize that utility, or you can utilize alternatives included in our [best free driver updater for Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-best-free-driver-updaters/) guide.

 After scanning your PC with Driver Booster or one of the alternatives, you’ll be able to select update driver options for the devices listed. If your PC’s camera is listed among the devices with an outdated driver, select to update it. The software will download and install the latest for it from its database.

![Driver Booster software](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/driver-booster.jpg)

 Alternatively, you can find and replace an outdated camera driver without third-party software. The other way to do it is to manually download the latest driver for your camera from the manufacturer’s website and install it.

## 6\. Clean Boot Your PC

 To prevent software conflicts that could potentially cause error 0xA00F425D, try setting Windows 11/10 to clean boot. Doing so will disable third-party apps and services from starting with Windows. Check out our guide about [clean booting on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/) for details about how to apply this potential solution by disabling such startup items with Task Manager and MSConfig.

![The Services tab in MSConfig](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/services-tab.jpg)

## 7\. Delete Your PC’s Most Recent Windows Patch Update

 Sometimes error 0xA00F425D can be triggered by a newly installed Windows patch update. Such updates have introduced bugs that have broken webcams on Windows 10 in the past. The KB4601319 cumulative update is a recent example. If your PC has recently received an update, there’s a slight possibility that could have caused 0xA00F425D.

 Deleting your PC’s most recent Windows update would fix the error if that’s the case. You can apply such a potential resolution by manually uninstalling the latest update listed in the Control Panel’s Programs and Features applet. Our guide to [uninstalling Windows updates](https://www.makeuseof.com/manually-uninstall-windows-10-updates/) includes step-by-step instructions for how to do that.
