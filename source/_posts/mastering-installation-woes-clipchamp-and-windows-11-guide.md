 The app offers multiple editable templates (free and paid) using which you can[easily create cool videos on Windows with Clipchamp](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-clipchamp-create-cool-videos/) . Unlike Adobe or other video software, it doesn't stress your system resources and even offers the option to download your videos and share them with others.

## How to Fix Clipchamp Not Installing on Windows 11

 If you are unable to install this free video editing tool on your system, try out the following fixes to successfully install and run it on your computer.

### 1\. Completely Close and Relaunch the Microsoft Store

 Microsoft Store app can become unresponsive and fail to install the app on your system. So, you must terminate the app and restart it. Here's how to do it:

1. Press**Win + I** to launch the Settings app. Navigate to the left-hand side menu and click on the**Apps** option.
2. Click on the**Installed Apps** option. Then click on the**Search for app** option and type Microsoft Store.
3. Click on the three horizontal dots and select the**Advanced options** from the context menu.  
![Completely Close and Relaunch Microsoft Store](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/completely-close-and-relaunch-microsoft-store.jpg)
4. Scroll down and click on the**Terminate** button. It will end the Microsoft process and close the app.

### 2\. Restart Your Computer

 If terminating the app doesn't do anything, do a system restart. It will clear all the apps from the memory, close all the background apps and services, and restart them. Do not use shutdown because Microsoft enables Fast start-up by default and that doesn't close system and kernel-level processes from the memory.

 After your computer restarts, launch Microsoft Store and try to install the Clipchamp app on your system.

### 3\. Set the Correct Time, Date, and Region

 Incorrect date and time and region settings can cause the Microsoft Store app to not load content or install apps properly. Here's how to update the date, time, and region on your system:

1. Press**Win + I** to launch the Settings app.
2. Click on the**Time & language** option from the left-hand side menu.
3. Click on the**Date & time** option and then click on the**Sync now** button.
