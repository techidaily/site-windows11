2. Click on the **Rufus link** to download the latest version.

5. Click the drop-down for **Boot selection** and select **Disk or ISO image.**

1. Then, click the **SELECT** button.

## 2\. How to Create a Windows 11 Bootable USB Drive Using the Media Creation Tool

 The media creation tool is Microsoft's in-house solution to create an installation media. You can use the media creation tool to create a bootable USB flash drive or download the ISO file to your local drive. Since it needs to download the ISO to create a bootable drive, you cannot use an existing Windows ISO image with this tool.

 To create an installation media using the media creation tool:

1. Connect your USB flash drive of at least 8GB to your PC. Make sure it is detected and you have taken a backup of all the files on your USB drive.
2. Next, visit the [Microsoft download center](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11) page.
3. Under the **Create Windows 11 Installation Media** section, click the **Download Now** button and save the file to your PC.
4. Next, run the **Mediacreationtool.exe** file and click **Yes** if prompted by UAC. The tool may take a few seconds to launch, so wait till you see the **Setup wizard.**
5. Click the **Accept button** to agree to the terms.  
![select language and edition Create bootable drive windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/select-langugae-and-edition.png)

1. The media creation tool will automatically select the **Edition** and **Language** to match the current Windows configuration on your PC. To change the language, uncheck **Use the recommended options for this PC** box and select your preferred language from the drop-down menu.

## 3\. How to Create a Bootable Drive Using Command Prompt

 If you don’t want to use a third-party tool to create a bootable drive, you can use the Diskpart utility and Command Prompt to create installation media. Here's how to do it.

1. First, take a backup of all the files on your USB drive and then connect it to your PC.
2. Press the **Win** key, type cmd, **and** click on **Run as Administrator** under **Command Prompt.** You can also use PowerShell if you prefer it over Command Prompt.

![disk part windows 11 bootable drive](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/disk-part-windows-11-bootable-drive.png)
3. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and hit enter to launch the **Windows Diskpart** utility.  
`DISKPART`
4. Next, type the following command to list all the available storage devices:  
`LIST DISK`
5. Here, locate your USB drive. You can look at the **Size column** to determine your USB drive. In this case, the USB drive is listed as **Disk 2.**

1. Next, type the following command to select your drive:  
`SEL DISK 2`
2. In the above command, change **DISK 2** with the number assigned to your USB drive. For example, if you have a single SSD or SATA drive setup, your primary drive will show as **DISK 0** and USB drive as **DISK 1**. It is of **extreme importance that you select the right drive** as the next step involves wiping clean the selected drive.
3. Once the drive is erased, type the following command and hit enter to erase all the content from the drive:  
`Clean`
4. Next, type the following command to create a primary partition:

7. Type the following command and hit enter to activate the partition:  
`Active`
8. Then type the following command to format the USB drive. It is important to format the drive in NTFS format as the [FAT32 format will cause the incorrect parameter error](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-fix-parameter-is-incorrect-error/).  
`FORMAT FS=NTFS LABEL=&ldquo;BootableUSB&rdquo; QUICK OVERRIDE`
9. Once done, type **Exit** and hit enter to exit the Disk Part utility.

 Now you will need to mount the ISO image and then move its content to your USB drive.
