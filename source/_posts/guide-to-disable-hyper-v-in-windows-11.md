## Guide to Disable Hyper-V in Windows 11

### Key Takeaways

* Hyper-V can conflict with third-party virtualization tools and apps on Windows 11, causing errors when launching them. Disabling Hyper-V can resolve this issue.
* You can disable Hyper-V using the Windows Features dialog or the BCDEdit tool. Restart your PC after making changes to apply them.
* If the Windows Features dialog fails, use the Command Prompt or PowerShell to disable Hyper-V. Uninstall Hyper-V's virtual network adapters and disable Memory Integrity and Device Guard/Credential Guard for optimal performance.

 Hyper-V comes pre-installed on Windows 11 computers. While this virtualization tool is not available out of the box on the Home edition of the OS, you can install it with a batch script.

 Unfortunately, Hyper-V can conflict with third-party apps on your PC, including other virtualization tools such as VMWare Workstation, VirtualBox, and emulators. As a result, you may encounter the Hyper-V detected error when trying to launch an app, PC games, or hardware tuning utilities.

 Luckily, you can disable Hyper-V in Windows 11 with the help of the classic Windows Features dialog, Command Prompt, and PowerShell.

## Why You May Need to Disable Hyper-V

 By design, only one virtualization tool can use the integrated virtualization extension, such as Intel VT-x and AMD-V, available on your processor. If you need to use third-party virtualization software, including VMware WorkStation and Virtual Box, you must disable the Hyper-V Hypervisor.

 You may also need to disable other hypervisor-dependent features, including Device Guard, Credential Guard, and memory integrity feature part of Core Isolation in Windows Security.

## How to Turn Off Virtualization-Based Security (Memory Integrity)

 If you encounter the Hyper-V detected issue even after you disable Hyper-V, try to disable the Memory integrity feature in Windows Security. The Memory integrity feature is part of Core Isolation. It helps prevent hackers from accessing and infecting high-security processes using malicious code.

 By default, Windows disables the Memory integrity feature to avoid conflict with apps and device drivers due to incompatibility issues. This can also cause issues with third-party virtualization tools and programs needing access to your system's virtualization hardware.

 To turn off Memory integrity in Windows Security:

1. Press **Win + I** to open the **Settings** app.
2. In the left pane, click on the **Privacy & security** tab.  
![Privacy and security Windows security](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/privacy-and-security-windows-security.jpg)
3. Next, click on **Windows Security**.
4. Under the **Protection areas** section, click on **Device security.**

## How to Disable Device Guard and Credential Guard

 Device Guard and Credential Guard don't play well with other virtualization software, including VMware Workstation. You may encounter an error saying Device Guard/Credential Guard is enabled when trying to power on the VMware Workstation.

 Since you intend to use third-party virtualization software, you can safely disable Device Guard and Credential Guard using the Registry Editor.

 That said, modifying the Windows Registry involves risk. We recommend you [create a restore point](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) and [take a registry backup](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/backup-restore-windows-registry/) before attempting any modifications.

 To disable Device Guard and Credential Guard:

1. Press **Win + R** to open **Run**.
2. Type **regedit** and click **OK** to open **Registry Editor**.
3. In Registry Editor, navigate to the following location:  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`
4. In the right pane, locate the **LsaCfgFlags** **DWORD** value. You'll need to create a new key if no such value exists.  
![Windows registry editor Lsa subkey create New value](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/windows-registry-editor-lsa-subkey-create-new-value.jpg)
5. To create a new key, right-click the **Lsa** subkey in the left pane and select **New < DWORD (32-bit)** **value**. Rename the value as **LsaCfgFlags**.

1. Next, double-click on **LsaCfgFlags** and type **0** in the **Value data** field.  
![Windows registry editor Lsa subkey value 0](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/windows-registry-editor-lsa-subkey-value-0.jpg)
2. Click **OK** to save the changes.
