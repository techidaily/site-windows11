 Icon grouping is when Windows 11 combines multiple windows of a single program together. For example, having multiple File Explorer windows open will show as one File Explorer icon with multiple tabs behind it.

 This results in a cleaner and less cluttered taskbar, but one that gives you significantly less information. Some users [restore the old taskbar labels on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-10-taskbar-labels/), but this takes up more space on your taskbar than the icons do.

 The quickest way to disable this function is to use a program called Windhawk. Windhawk carries a number of quality-of-life modifications for Windows 11\.

 To start, head over to [the Windhawk website](https://windhawk.net) and download the program. Install it and run it afterward.

 Click on the **Explore** button, and search for **Disable grouping on the taskbar.** Go into **Details** and hit the **Install** button. After a few seconds, it'll be enabled, but you may need to [restart Windows File Explorer](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-restart-file-explorer-windows-10/) or your overall system to see the difference.

 You can also modify how the modification behaves by clicking **Details** and then **Settings.** You can enable or disable features like keeping the icons together, or to separate the pinned apps from the rest of the open windows.

## Achieve Supreme Taskbar Flexibility With Windhawk
