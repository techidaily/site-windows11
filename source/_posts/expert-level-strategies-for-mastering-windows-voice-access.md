## Expert-Level Strategies for Mastering Windows Voice Access

 Narrator is a screen reader from Microsoft that assists with navigation and access to information. It reads text, provides voice assistance, and navigates screen content. Visually impaired or low-vision individuals can better comprehend what's on their computer screens with its help.

 In this article, we've put together a complete list of legacy keyboard shortcuts that you can use to make your Narrator experience more seamless.
