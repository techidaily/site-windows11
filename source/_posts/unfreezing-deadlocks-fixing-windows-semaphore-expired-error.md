## 4\. Perform Generic Windows-Based Fixes for Troubleshooting USB Drives

 If you're still struggling with this error, here are some more general Windows-based fixes you can try:

### Run a System File Check Scan

 Corrupted or missing system files on your PC’s drive can cause operations to time out. To resolve such an issue, run a System File Checker command. You can repair the system files on an internal hard drive by executing a standard SFC command as outlined in our guide to [running the SFC tool on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/).

![The SFC scannow command](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/sfc-scannow-command.jpg)

### Run the CHKDSK Scan Command

 CHKDSK is Windows’ Check Disk utility that scans and repairs bad drive sectors. That tool could be useful for fixing error 0x80070079 if it’s caused by disk errors on a drive you’re trying to transfer files to. So, try scanning the target drive by running the CHKDSK via the Command Prompt. Our guide on [running Check Disk scans on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/sir-mini-how-to-run-chkdsk-in-windows-10/#:~:text=The%20CHKDSK%20utility%20scans%20your,and%20sizes%2C%20and%20bad%20sectors.) includes full instructions for applying this potential fix.

### Turn Off Any Active Firewalls

 Disabling firewalls might work when 0x80070079 occurs for wireless transfers from or to network drives. A firewall can block communication with a network drive. So, try temporarily [disabling Windows Defender Firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-disable-microsoft-defender-firewall/) before transferring any data from or to a network drive. Or turn off any third-party firewall installed.

### Disable Your Antivirus Shields

 If you’ve installed a third-party antivirus (security) utility, that might be causing the issue by preventing or restricting data transfer between drives. Temporarily disable your antivirus software’s shield before selecting to move or copy files from one drive to another. To do that, click on the antivirus tool’s system tray icon with the right mouse button and select the disable shield option.

### Perform a Clean Boot

 Some users confirm performing a clean boot fixes error 0x80070079\. Applying a clean boot will disable all third-party startup apps and services from starting. This resolution might eliminate third-party background program conflicts interfering with the data transfer and causing error 0x80070079\.

 You can apply this resolution by following the instructions in our [guide to performing a clean boot](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/).

### Change Your External Drive to NTFS Format

 Some Windows PC users have fixed error 0x80070079 by reformatting their external USB drives to the NTFS format. The reason this resolution has worked for some users is probably that FAT32 can’t store single files larger than four gigabytes. Reformatting a FAT32 drive to NTFS will eliminate such a restriction.

![The Format window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/format-seagate-drive.jpg)

 You can apply this possible resolution as covered within our guide to [reformatting USB drives in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-format-usb-drive-ntfs/).

 Reformatting a drive will wipe all the data on it. So, make sure you back up the drive’s data before reformatting if you want to keep any files on it.

### Reset Your Network

 This potential resolution is more applicable for users who encounter error 0x80070079 with network storage drives.

To apply this resolution, check out our [how to reset your network settings on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/reset-network-settings-windows-11/) guide.

![The Reset now button](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/the-reset-now-button.jpg)
