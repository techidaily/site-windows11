## Ejecting Unsolicited Windows Updates

 Microsoft regularly releases patch updates to enhance your device's performance and security. When you download this update, Windows often replaces the usual Shut Down and Restart buttons with “Update and shut down” to remind you not to miss the update.

 However, you may sometimes encounter the same message prompting even after performing these actions. Read this guide to resolve this issue and stop getting such annoying notifications.

## 1\. Restart the Computer From Settings

 If restarting your computer with the power button does not work, do it via the Settings Menu. This trick has worked for many users who encountered the same issue. Try it and see if that helps.

1. [Open the Settings menu](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-ways-to-open-system-settings/).
2. Click **Windows Update** in the left sidebar.
3. Under Windows Update, you will find the **Restart now** option.
4. Select this option to restart your computer and install the pending updates.

## 2\. Install Pending Updates

 If your computer keeps reminding you to update and shuts down, check for pending updates. It is possible that the updates were not installed properly and Windows is now asking you to complete them.

 To check for pending updates, follow these steps.

1. Press **Win + I** on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.
2. From the left sidebar, click on the **Windows Update** tab.
3. Select the **Check for updates** option from the right pane.

 This will search for available updates and install them if there are any. If you see no updates, continue to the next solution.

## 3\. Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter

 Windows operating system comes with troubleshooting tools specific to each problem. To solve update-related issues, use the Windows Update troubleshooter. This tool detects corrupted, or faulty files associated with updates and fixes them automatically.

 To run the Windows Update Troubleshooter, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on **Start** and select **Settings** from the menu list.
2. Select **Windows Update** in the left sidebar, then click **Troubleshoot**.
3. On the next page, click **Other trouble-shooters**.

## 4\. Clear the Software Distribution Folder

1. Open the Start menu and type CMD in the search bar.
2. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** on your keyboard. This will open the Command Prompt as an administrator.
3. If a User Account Control window appears, click **Yes** to grant administrative privileges.

`net stop wuauserv  
net stop bits  
net stop cryptSvc  
net stop msiserver`
5. After that, open File Explorer and navigate to this path:

6. In the SoftwareDistribution folder, select all the files and delete them permanently.

6. Click **Apply** \> **OK** to save the changes.
7. Now close the window and restart your computer.

 Sometimes you may not see the Restart option in the Start menu. In that case, [run the command prompt as an administrator](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/). Now type **shutdown -s -t 0** in the command prompt and hit Enter. This will restart your computer immediately.

 Here **0** is the time in seconds. If you want to delay the restart, use a higher number. For example, shutdown -s -t 10 will delay the restart by 10 seconds.

 ​​​​​After restarting, you should no longer see the “Update and Restart” or “Update and Shut Down” message.
