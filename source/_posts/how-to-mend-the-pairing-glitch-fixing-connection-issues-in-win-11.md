## How to Mend the Pairing Glitch: Fixing Connection Issues in Win 11

 Many users utilize wireless Bluetooth devices with Windows 11/10 PCs. Yet, some users have said they see “Try connecting your device again” or “Try connecting again” error messages in Windows when they try pairing Bluetooth devices. Those similar error messages appear within the Add a device window.

 Consequently, users can’t connect Bluetooth devices like mice, headphones, and speakers because of that issue. It’s an annoying issue that users must get fixed to utilize their Bluetooth devices. This is how you can resolve the “Try connecting your device” error in Windows 11/10.

## 1\. Run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter

 Windows has a Bluetooth troubleshooter that could be useful for fixing the “Try connecting your device” error. That troubleshooter isn’t a guaranteed fix, but it’s worth trying given that it’s designed to resolve Bluetooth issues. You can open the Bluetooth troubleshooter like this:

1. Activate Settings by simultaneously pressing the**Windows** logo +**I** keys on your keyboard.
2. Then select the**System** tab and Troubleshoot to view three navigation options.
3. Click**Other trouble-shooters** to go to the list of troubleshooting utilities.
4. Press the Bluetooth troubleshooter’s**Run** button.

 To run the Bluetooth troubleshooter in Windows 10, click**Update & Security** within that platform’s Settings app. Click the**Troubleshoot** tab and select**Additional troubleshooters** from there; select**Bluetooth** to access the**Run the troubleshooter** option.

## 2\. Start or Restart the Bluetooth Services

 The Bluetooth Support Service needs to be enabled and running for Bluetooth to work. Users have said on Microsoft’s support forum they were able to resolve the “Try connecting your device again” error by starting that service. So, try starting or restarting the Bluetooth Support Service as follows:

1. Bring up the file and app search tool with its**Win + S** hotkey.

3. Select the Bluetooth Support Service Properties window’s**OK** option.
4. Repeat the above steps for all other Bluetooth-related services.
5. Restart your PC after adjusting the Bluetooth services.

## 3\. Reconfigure the Log On Settings for the Bluetooth Support Service
