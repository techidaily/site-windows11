## 4\. Clear the SoftwareDistribution Folder

 The Software Distribution folder is where Windows stores data related to updates. It includes temporary files and download logs. Corrupted or missing system files in this folder can cause the 0x8024800C issue. To fix it, you must delete these files from your system. Here’s how:

 To get started, [open Command Prompt with administrative privileges](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/). Once you're in an elevated command prompt window, run the following command:

`net stop wuauserv  
net stop bits`

 This will halt the Windows Update service and the Background Intelligent Transfer Service.

 Now use the **Win + E** shortcut key to open File Explorer. Then navigate to the "C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution" folder and delete all its contents. You don't need to delete the folder itself; just the files within it.

![Clear SoftwareDistribution Folder](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/clear-softwaredistribution-folder.jpg)

 Once you're done, go back to the Command Prompt and type the following commands:

`net start wuauserv  
net start bits`

 This will restart the Windows Update service and the Background Intelligent Transfer Service. Now try downloading updates for your computer.
