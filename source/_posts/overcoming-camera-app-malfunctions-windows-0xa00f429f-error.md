## Overcoming Camera App Malfunctions: Windows' 0XA00F429F Error

 Webcams are essential for video conference calls and making videos. However, some users can’t use their webcams with the Windows Camera app because of the 0xA00F429F error. The error shows a “Can’t start your camera” message with the code 0xA00F429F (and 0x887A0004) in the Windows Camera app.

 That issue can be a big inconvenience for users who often utilize the Camera app. If error 0xA00F429F is preventing you from recording with the Camera app, here is how you can fix it in Windows 11 and 10.

## 1\. Enable Webcam Access for the Affected Apps

 You can’t use your PC’s webcam with Windows Camera if camera access for apps is disabled. So, check the basic camera access settings for apps are enabled in Windows before anything else. You can enable webcam app access within Windows 11' Settings like this:

1. Press**Win + I** to access the Settings app quickly.
2. Select**Privacy & security** to view navigation options for that tab.

5. Then toggle on the Windows Camera app access setting.

 The Settings app’s layout is a little different in Windows 10, but you can still configure camera access much the same. Click**Privacy** \>**Camera** in Windows 10’s Settings app to reach the required options. Then click the**Change** button to turn on the**Camera** access for this device option.

4. Then input**EnableFrameServerMode** in the DWORD’s name box.
