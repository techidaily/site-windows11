## Microsoft Word's Silent Mode Fix for PC Users

 Read Aloud is a great productivity feature, especially when you want to give your eyes a break. You can have Word read the document for you starting from your cursor and even pause or skip forward and backward to re-listen to important parts.

 So it’s definitely inconvenient when Word’s Read Aloud feature stops working. If this happened to you, there’s no need to fret. We’ve put together a quick guide that will help you fix the issue.

## 1\. Restart Microsoft Word

 As always, when dealing with a program malfunction, you should restart it. If there’s a temporary glitch, closing and re-launching Microsoft Word might be enough to fix the issue. Once you close Microsoft Word, make sure there’s no background process still running.

 Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** to bring up the Task Manager. There, right-click **Microsoft Word** and select **End task**.

 Open Word and check if the problem is now solved.

## 2\. Enable the Read Aloud Feature

 You can also have Word read the document for you by pressing **Ctrl + Alt + Space**. If nothing happens when using this keyboard shortcut and Read Aloud seems to be missing from the Ribbon menu, you should enable the feature. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Launch Microsoft Word.
2. Head to **File > Options**.
3. From the left pane, click on **Customize Ribbon**.
4. Open the **Choose command from** the drop-down menu and select **Main Tabs**.
5. Expand the **Review** list.
6. Choose **Speech**.
7. Click the **Add** button.
8. Click **OK** to save the new Word settings.

 Now, the Read Aloud feature should be available in the **Review** tab, within the **Speech** menu.

## 3\. Check Volume Mixer Settings

 There’s a chance you can’t hear Word Read Aloud feature due to incorrect Volume Mixer settings. As you may know, Windows’ Volume Mixer allows you to [set different volume levels for different applications](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-change-volume-on-a-per-app-basis-in-windows-10/) or change the output device for each running app.

 To check the settings, right-click the **Speaker** icon in the taskbar and select **Open Volume Mixer**. There, head to the **Apps** list and check the volume slider for Microsoft Word. Also, click on the app and check the selected output device.

 If there’s nothing wrong with the Volume Mixer settings, move on to the next solutions.

## 4\. Update Microsoft 365

 If restarting Microsoft Word wasn’t enough to fix the glitch, you should update Microsoft 365\. If you’re running an outdated version or something went wrong during the latest update installation, you’ll encounter all sorts of issues. Including Word’s inability to read the documents for you.

 To update Microsoft 365, open Microsoft Word and go to **File > Account**. There, click **Update options** and select **Update now**. If you can’t update it, check out our guide on how to [fix Microsoft 365 installation errors in Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-fix-microsoft-365-office-home-and-student-installation-errors-windows/).

## 5\. Repair the Word Doc

 If you notice the Read Aloud issue is limited to an individual document, there’s a chance you’re dealing with a corrupted Word doc. If possible, re-download the document or ask the sender for a different version.

 Alternatively, you can try using Microsoft Word's built-in repair option.

1. Open the **File** menu.
2. Click **Open** and browse to the doc’s location.
3. Extend the **Tools** menu and select **Open and Repair**.

 Microsoft Word will now search and automatically fix any detected issues.

## 6\. Repair Microsoft 365

[Windows has plenty of built-in repair tools](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-free-tools-fix-problem-windows-10/) to help you when running into a problem. So if Word is still giving you the silent treatment, go through the steps below:

1. Press **Windows key + I** to bring up the Settings menu.
2. Go to **Apps > Installed apps**.
3. Locate **Microsoft 365** and click the **three-dot** icon next to it.
4. Select **Modify**.
5. Click the **Repair** button.
6. Select **Quick Repair** and click **Repair** to start the process.

 If the Read Aloudfeature is still not working, go through the steps again and select **Online Repair**.

## 7\. Launch Word in Safe Mode

 Sometimes, add-ins might interfere with Word’s functionality and stop Read Aloud from working. To check if you’re dealing with a problematic add-in, launch Word in Safe Mode. Press **Windows key + R** to launch a Run dialog, type **winword / safe** and press **Enter**. Word will now open without any add-ins.

 If the Read Aloud feature works in Safe Mode, you’ll have to identify the conflictual add-in. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Click **File > Options**.
2. From the left-hand menu, select **Add-ins**.
3. Set **Manage** to **COM Add-ins** and click **Go**.
4. Uncheck every add-in and click **OK**.
5. Then, re-enable the add-in one by one to identify which one is causing the issue.

## Get Word Reading Your Docs Aloud

 Hopefully, one or more of the fixes above helped you fix the problem. If you’re facing the same issue, it might be time to reinstall Microsoft 365 or contact Microsoft support and let them know about the problem.

 Now, to keep Word working at its best, don’t miss out on any updates. Also, you might have no chance of fixing Word’s Read Aloud feature if you’re using a pirated version.

 So it’s definitely inconvenient when Word’s Read Aloud feature stops working. If this happened to you, there’s no need to fret. We’ve put together a quick guide that will help you fix the issue.
