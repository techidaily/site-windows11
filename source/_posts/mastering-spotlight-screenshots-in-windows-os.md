## Mastering Spotlight Screenshots in Windows OS

 With the Windows Spotlight feature enabled, your lock screen gets updated every day with spectacular images from Bing. That said, not everyone may like seeing a different lock screen background daily.

 In any case, it’s fairly simple to enable or disable spotlight images on your Windows lock screen. Here's how you can go about it.

 The Settings app in Windows gives you several options for[customizing the lock screen](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-customize-lock-screen/) , including the ability to enable or disable spotlight images. It is also the quickest method for turning spotlight images on or off on Windows. Here are the steps you can follow.

2. Select**Personalization** from the left pane.
3. Click on**Lock screen** .
