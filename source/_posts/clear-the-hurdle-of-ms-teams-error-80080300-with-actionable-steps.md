## Clear the Hurdle of MS Teams Error 80080300 with Actionable Steps

 Many users utilize Microsoft Teams, a free messaging app with Windows 11\. However, some users can’t use that app because of the Microsoft Teams error 80080300\. The 80080300 error displays a message that says, “we’re sorry, we’ve run into an issue.”

 Consequently, users can’t log in to MS Teams when the app throws up that error. Those users might still be able to log in via browsers, but the Windows app displays an 80080300 error code. Here is how you can fix Microsoft Teams error 80080300 in Windows 11.

## 1\. Disconnect Your Microsoft Work or School Account

 If you’re utilizing a Microsoft work or school account, we recommend you disconnect from it on your PC. Doing so will eliminate one potential cause of error 0080300\. You can disconnect from a Microsoft work or school account you’re connected with via Settings like this:

1. Press**Win +** **X** to view the Power User menu, and select the**Settings** shortcut.

5. Press the**Disconnect** button.
6. Click**Yes** to confirm you’re sure.
7. Try utilizing the Microsoft Teams app with that account disconnected.

## 2\. Run Teams in Compatibility Mode

 Teams users have had some joy fixing the 80080300 error by selecting to run that app in compatibility mode. That’s a surprising potential fix considering Teams comes bundled with Windows 11, but users have confirmed it works. So, try running Microsoft Teams in compatibility mode as follows:

1. Open the Explorer drive navigator by pressing the**Windows** key +**E** .
2. Bring up this directory:  
`C:\Users\<user folder>AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\MicrosoftTeams_8wekyb3d8bbwe`
3. Right-click the**msteams.exe** file and select**Properties** .

![The Run this program in compatibility mode for checkbox](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/run-in-compatibility-mode-option.jpg)
6. Select the**Windows 8** option on the drop-down menu.
7. Click**Apply** to save the new compatibility setting.

 Note that the WindowsApps folder that includes the pre-installed MS Teams app in Windows 11 is protected. So, you’ll need to unlock the WindowsApps folder to access msteams.exe as instructed above.

## 3\. Run the Compatibility Troubleshooter for Microsoft Teams

 This potential error 80080300 resolution is similar to the previous fix, and it’s another that has worked for some users. Running the compatibility troubleshooter for MS Teams can resolve app compatibility issues. This is how to run that troubleshooter in Windows 11.
