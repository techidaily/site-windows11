## Methods for Reviving Your Windows 11 Password

 Despite Microsoft’s attempt to push more users towards adopting the Windows Hello-based sign-in options, the old password-based login is still part of Windows 11\. And for a good reason.

 Even if you prefer a PIN over the conventional password sign-in, you can set an account password as a backup option. It is a handy way to sign in if you forget your PIN or encounter an error. But what if you have forgotten your account password? Let's explore the many ways to change your account password in Windows 11.

## What If You Have Forgotten Your Windows Administrator Password?

 Most Windows computers have more than one sign-in option. So, if your[Windows user account PIN isn’t working](https://www.makeuseof.com/something-happened-your-pin-isnt-available-windows/) , you can use the account password to sign in and vice versa.

 To be able to change your account password, you must either remember your current password or be able to log in to your PC with an alternate sign-in option. If you are locked out of your account without no option to sign in, follow our guide to[reset a forgotten Windows administrator password](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/3-ways-to-reset-the-forgotten-windows-administrator-password/) instead.

## 1\. Change the Account Password Using Ctrl + Alt + Delete

 Follow these steps to quickly change your account password from the Ctrl + Alt + Delete user menu:

1. Press**Ctrl + Alt + Delete** on your keyboard to view the available options.
2. Next, click on**Change** **a password** option.
