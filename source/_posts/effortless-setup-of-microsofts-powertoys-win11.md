 Microsoft PowerToys is a collection of productivity tools that enhance your Windows experience to the next level. This software package offers awesome features like FancyZones for custom window layouts, PowerRename for bulk file renaming, and the Shortcut Guide for easy access to Windows key shortcuts.

 To access these features, you need Microsoft PowerToys installed on your PC. Let's look at the different ways you can install it on your Windows computer and walk through the installation process for each.

## 1\. Install Microsoft PowerToys From the Microsoft Store

 Microsoft Store is an online marketplace pre-installed on Windows. It offers a diverse array of free and paid apps, games, and even device updates, all in one place. This gives Windows users access to everything they need under one roof.

 To install Microsoft PowerToys from the Microsoft Store, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + Q** and type **Microsoft Store** in the search bar.
2. Click on the **Microsoft Store** icon in the search results.
3. On the Microsoft Store page, search for **PowerToys**. The next page will provide a detailed overview of the software package. Please read it carefully before continuing.
4. If you feel satisfied, click **Install** to begin the downloading & installation process. The process might take a few minutes.
