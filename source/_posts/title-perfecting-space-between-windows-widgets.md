## Title: Perfecting Space Between Windows Widgets

 Windows 11 includes three desktop context menu options for changing icon size. However, those settings do nothing to change the spacing between icons. Nor does the Settings app or Control Panel offer any configuration settings with which to adjust icon spacing variables.

 As such, it might seem that you can’t change icon spacing on the desktop in Windows 11/10\. However, Windows 11 does have two hidden settings for changing the vertical and horizontal desktop icon spacing in the form of registry strings. Here is how you can change desktop icon spacing in Windows 11/10 in two different ways.

## How to Change Desktop Icon Spacing By Manually Editing the Registry

 The registry is one big database of configuration settings that you can edit to customize Windows. It includes a WindowsMetrics key that incorporates IconSpacing and IconVerticalSpacing strings.

 You can tweak these hidden options and create the desktop icon spacing you want as follows:

1. Click the**Start** button on the taskbar with the right mouse button to select the**Run** shortcut.
2. To[open the Registry Editor](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-registry-editor/) , enter**regedit** in the Run and select**OK** .
3. Go to the **Computer\\HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\WindowMetrics** registry key. You can copy and paste that registry location in the address bar or click the keys for it on the left sidebar.
4. Select the**WindowMetrics** key.  
![The WindowMetrics key](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/windowsmetrics-key.jpg)
5. Double-click the**WindowMetrics** key's**IconSpacing** string, which changes the horizontal spacing for desktop icons.

1. Then erase the current**\-1125** number from the Value data box.
2. Enter a replacement value with a minus (-) sign in front of it. For example, entering**\-1180** will slightly increase the horizontal spacing.  
![The Edit String window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/edit-string-window.jpg)
3. Press the**OK** button to close IconString’s Edit String window.
4. Next, double-click the**IconVerticalSpacing** string setting, with which you can modify vertical icon spacing.
5. Clear the current value, and then input another number with a minus sign in front of it. If you want the vertical spacing to be the same as the horizontal, enter a number there that matches the IconSpacing value.
6. Click the Edit String window’s**OK** button.
7. Exit the Registry Editor.
8. You’ll need to restart Windows to apply this[registry tweak](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-windows-10-registry-tweaks-improve-unlock-features/) .

 After the restart, the icon spacing on your desktop will have changed according to the new**IconString** and**IconVerticalSpacing** values you entered. You’ll notice the difference if you entered notably higher or lower values. Don’t get too carried away by entering values that are far too low or high. The shortcuts’ labels will overlap with too little spacing and some icons might disappear from the desktop if you expand the space between them too much.

 Now you might wonder how you can restore the default desktop icon spacing. The default spacing value for both the strings is**\-1125** , which amounts to 75 pixels. So, return to the WindowMetric registry key and enter**\-1125** for both the**IconString** and**IconVerticalSpacing** string values. Thereafter, restart your PC to restore the default spacing.

## How Much Icon Space Do You Want on Your Desktop?

 So, would you prefer the desktop icons in Windows 11/10 to have more or less space between them? Reducing desktop icon space will free up space for more shortcuts. However, some Microsoft Surface touchscreen PC users might prefer to widen the spaces between icons a little bit. You can choose either way by manually editing the registry or adjusting spacing with Winaero Tweaker’s**Icon** option or the Windows-Metrics utility in DesktopOK.
