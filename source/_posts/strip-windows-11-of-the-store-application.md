## Strip Windows 11 of the Store Application

 Microsoft Store is the go-to place for Windows users if they want to install an app. The app library is slowly expanding, and you will find all the popular apps without any difficulty. But sometimes the Microsoft Store application behaves abnormally and requires troubleshooting.

 But what if it still doesn’t work, even after repairing and resetting? There is no uninstall option in the Settings app, so it is possible to uninstall Microsoft Store? Well, it is possible to remove and reinstall the Microsoft Store app. Here’s how.

## Why Should You Uninstall the Microsoft Store App?

 Microsoft Store houses all the useful and popular applications for Windows devices. Moreover, it guarantees safe and malware-free application downloads. But if the app fails to start or doesn’t work properly, removing it makes sense.

 But don’t worry. You can remove the app and then reinstall it if you want. Reinstallation can fix persistent issues with the current version of the Microsoft Store app. It will remove the current app installation and all its related files and corrupt data. After that, you can reinstall the Microsoft app with a single command.

## How to Uninstall Microsoft Store App From Windows 11

 You can remove the Microsoft Store app from Windows 11 using the winget tool and run it using the command prompt. In addition, you can use the PowerShell cmdlet to remove the Microsoft Store application package from your system or use a batch file.
