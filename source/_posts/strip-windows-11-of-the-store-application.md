### 2\. Using PowerShell

 Before winget was officially integrated into Windows 10 and 11, there was a method to [remove the Microsoft Store app using PowerShell](https://www.makeuseof.com/remove-reinstall-microsoft-store-windows-11/) . The method still works and all you need to do is list the package name and then use the**Remove-AppxPackage** cmdlet to uninstall the Microsoft Store app from your system. Make sure to run PowerShell with elevated permissions.

### 3\. Using a Batch File

 If you want to save the hassle of typing commands every time you want to uninstall the Microsoft Store app, you can use a batch file. It will help you to remove Microsoft Store app from your system in a couple of clicks whenever the normal troubleshooting methods don’t work for you. Repeat the following steps:

1. Press**Win + D** to switch to the Desktop. Right-click on the Desktop and select the**New > Text Document** option.
2. Open the newly created text document file on the desktop. A Notepad window will pop up. Paste the following text in it:

3. Now, press**Ctrl + Shift + S** to open the "Save as" window. Name the batch file as**UninstallStore.bat** and keep the**Save as** type option as**All files** .
