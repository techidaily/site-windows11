## Deciphering Microsoft's Window File Format (CAB) for Ease of Use

 There are many ways to download driver and Windows updates, one of which is by visiting the Microsoft Update Catalog. The files downloaded from the Microsoft Update Catalog have a .CAB extension. Microsoft uses these files because they use lossless compression, which means that the original files remain unchanged when they are compressed.

 But what exactly is a Windows CAB file, and how do you install it on your computer? Here's everything you need to know.

## What Is a Windows CAB File?

 A CAB file or Cabinet file is a common archive file format used by Microsoft. It contains the compressed version of different files, folders, and even other cabinet files. Microsoft uses these files to distribute Windows, drivers, and UWP app updates. However, you can also use it to store other forms of data, such as images, videos, and documents.

 A CAB file is compressed using the Microsoft Cabinets Compression Format (MCF), which ensures that you can easily decompress it without losing the data stored in it. It can also be signed with digital certificates, allowing to maintain the authenticity and integrity of the file.

 CAB files are recognized by their first four bytes, which are the [ASCII characters](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-ascii-text/) MSCF. You can store up to 65,535 folders in a CAB file, with each folder having a storage capacity of 65,535 files.

 Now that you have a brief understanding of CAB files, let's check out how you can install it on Windows 11\.
