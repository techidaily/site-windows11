### Allow Mail Through the Windows Firewall

 If the Mail app is blocked under the Windows Firewall settings, it will fail to fetch emails and show the "System error can't get mail" error. To fix this, you'll have to [allow the Mail app to run through the Windows Firewall](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/) .
