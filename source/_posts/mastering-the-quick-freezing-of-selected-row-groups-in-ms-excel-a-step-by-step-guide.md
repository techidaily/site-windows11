[Freezing a single row](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-the-artisan-editor-refining-video-transitions-with-inshot/) is easy, but what if you want to freeze multiple rows at the top of your Microsoft Excel spreadsheet? Luckily, there's an option to do that, too, and we'll show you how to use it.

 Once you freeze your rows, those rows will stick to the top of your spreadsheet and won't move when you scroll down your spreadsheet.

##  Freeze Two or More Rows in Excel

 To start freezing your multiple rows, first, launch your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel.

 In your spreadsheet, select the row below the rows that you want to freeze. For example, if you want to freeze the first three rows, select the fourth row.
