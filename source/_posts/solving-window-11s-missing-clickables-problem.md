## Solving Window 11'S Missing Clickables Problem

 Troubleshooting Windows can be a tedious task, especially when nothing seems to be working. If you're having trouble clicking or performing any action on your computer running Windows 11, then here are some invaluable tips and tricks for getting things working again.

## 1\. Restart the Computer

 The first thing you should do is restart your computer. It will help clean out any temporary bugs and hopefully get things back to normal.

 People are used to clicking the Start button, then restarting via the Power menu. However, if you can't click on anything, you'll need to use one of the other [ways to restart your Windows computer](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-restart-methods/) that doesn't rely on a functioning mouse to perform.

 After your computer restarts, check to see if the issue has been resolved.

## 2\. Check Your Mouse for Loose Connections or Dirt

 If restarting the computer didn’t work, then you should check your mouse. Make sure it is plugged in properly and that all the cables are securely connected.

 You can also try cleaning the components with compressed air or a damp cloth, as dust and debris can sometimes interfere. If that doesn't work, you may want to use a different mouse to see if the issue is with your hardware or not.

## 3\. Restart Explorer.exe via the Task Manager

 If you are still unable to click on anything, it might be time to restart Explorer.exe. This process is straightforward and easy to follow; all you need to do is press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** , and the Task Manager will open.

 Once you’ve opened Task Manager, use the**Tab** and**arrow** keys to access the**Details** section. Now press**Enter** to view the options list, and then use the**down arrow** key to find and select**Explorer.exe** .

 Since your mouse is not working, you must now press**Shift + F10** in order to bring up the context menu. Select the**End task** option from the menu list and press**Enter** .

 In the confirmation window that appears, make sure the**End process** button is highlighted, and then press**Enter** to proceed.

 Now that you have stopped the Windows Explorer executable file, you must restart it. At this point, your desktop will turn black and everything except the Task Manager window will vanish. Don't worry; this is totally normal.

 At the top of the Task Manager window, click**Run new task** . If you still can't click on anything, navigate there using**Tab** instead.

 Then, in the text field, type**explorer.exe** and press the**Enter** key. This will cause an immediate restart of Explorer.exe, which should allow you to access your documents again.

 After restarting Explorer.exe, try clicking anywhere on your screen to see if the problem is fixed.

## 4\. Perform a System Restore

 System Restore is a straightforward yet powerful solution that can help you out of any bind. If you are still having trouble clicking anything on your computer, you can [use System Restore on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/system-restore-factory-reset-work-windows-10/) . This will reset all software settings on your machine to an earlier time which should fix underlying problems blocking clicks.

To use System Restore, follow these steps:

1. Press**Win + R** on your keyboard to launch the Run command.
2. In the dialog box, type**rstrui** and press**Enter** .
3. Select a restore point using the**Tab** button.
