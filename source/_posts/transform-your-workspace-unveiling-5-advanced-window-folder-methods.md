## Transform Your Workspace: Unveiling 5 Advanced Window Folder Methods

 We all use folders every day on our Windows PCs. You might have created folders to store new files and organize your data or made subfolders within a folder.

 Surely you'd like to know ways to make working with folders easier and better. So here are a few quick folder tips and tricks that make things easy and fun.

## 1\. Create an Invisible Secret Folder

 Create a folder faster through this shortcut: press and hold the **Ctrl + Shift** keys together on your keyboard and then press the **N** key. You can then name the folder.

 But did you know that you can create secret, invisible folders? It can be handy, especially if you share your PC with others or work in an environment that doesn't offer much privacy. Here's how:

1. When you create a folder, the name field underneath the folder gets selected for naming. But instead of naming the folder, press the **Alt** key followed by the number **255**, and then hit **Enter**.
2. The name field of the folder will disappear—actually, it's still there but becomes invisible.  
![Folder on Desktop With Name Field Invisible](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/name-field-of-folder-invisible-1.jpg)
3. Then make the folder invisible too. **Right-click** the folder and choose **Properties** from the menu.
4. In **Properties**, select the **Customize** tab. Then under **Folder icons**, select **Change icon**.  
![Select Change Icon In Customize Tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/change-icon-in-customize-tab.jpg)
5. In the **Change Icon for Folder** window scroll to the right with the arrow key to reach a blank space. This blank space is a blank icon—you will know when you select it. Then click on **OK**.

6. Back in the **Customize** tab, you will see no icon under **Folder icon**. Click **Apply** and then **OK**.  
![Folder Icon Not Visible in Customize Tab](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/folder-icon-not-visible.jpg)

 You will see that the default yellow folder icon has become invisible. Without selecting it, no one can see it. Only you know it is there.

 You can use this as a secret folder to store private and confidential data. Double-click it to open it and use it like a regular folder.

 And if you want to name it, right-click the folder and select **Rename** to make the name field visible.

## 2\. Rename Multiple Folders Together

 You don't need to click each folder name field and type the names to name or rename multiple folders together. Use the following method that works well within a folder with subfolders or in File Explorer:

1. After naming a folder, click on the **Tab** key.
2. The cursor will move to the name field of the next folder. Rename that folder and then click **Tab** again to move and name the next folder—and then the next.

3. When all the folders are named, click on **enter**.

 This way, you can name several folders together—quickly and easily.

## 3\. Duplicate a Folder Window

 This simple tip will save time and enhance your efficiency.

 When you're working within a folder that is open on your screen, press the **Ctrl + N** keys together. The folder window you're in will get duplicated.

 Now with two folder windows, you can move and navigate easily between subfolders and files.

## 4\. Change Folder Size With the Mouse

 You'll find this tip handy if you use a desktop PC with a mouse or a mouse with your laptop.

1. Left-click with your mouse on the desktop, in File Explorer, or within a folder.
2. Press and hold the **ctrl** key. Then use your **mouse scroll wheel** to change the size of folders on the desktop or subfolders within a folder.
