The article covers two methods for changing device usage options: using system settings and a reg file.

 Before we dig in, let's see what Device Usage Options are and how they affect your Windows experience.

## What Are the Device Usage Options on Windows?

 Device Usage Options allow you to customize your Windows experience by setting preferences for how ads are displayed. Microsoft also provides tips & suggestions and personalizes recommendations for you. Depending on your choice, Windows presents you with different types of information and services.

 Now that you know what Device Usage Options are, here's how to change them in Windows.

## 1\. Using Windows Settings

 Changing Device Usage Options on Windows is easy. There are two ways to do it - using System Settings or through a reg file. First, let's look at how to change Device Usage Options using Windows Settings.

 To get started, press **Win + I** on your keyboard. This will open the System Settings. From the left sidebar, click on the **Personalisation** tab. Scroll down in the right pane and click **Device usage**.

## 2\. Using a REG File

 If you're [unable to open the System Settings window or if it isn't working](https://www.makeuseof.com/fixes-unable-to-open-windows-settings/), use a reg file instead. A reg file is a registry key file that helps you tweak Windows settings.

### Gaming Device Usage Options

 To create a reg file for your desired Device Usage Options, [open Notepad](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-notepad/) and copy-paste the following:

`Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\gaming]  
"Intent"=dword:00000001  
"Priority"=dword:00000000  
  
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudExperienceHost\Intent\OffDeviceConsent]  
"accepted"=dword:00000001`

 Now click the **File** menu and select **Save as** from the options list. Choose **All files** from the **Save as type** drop-down menu and save it with a **.reg** extension to your desktop.

![Change Gaming Device Usage Options](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/change-gaming-device-usage-options.jpg)

 To apply the settings, double-click the reg file. This will turn on the Device usage options for Gaming.
