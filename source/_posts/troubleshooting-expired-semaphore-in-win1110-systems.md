## Troubleshooting Expired Semaphore in Win11/10 Systems

 Error 0x80070079 is an issue that can arise when users try to copy (or transfer) files between external USB or network storage drives and Windows PCs. The error 0x80070079 message says, “The semaphore timeout period has expired.” As a result, users can’t copy or move files between their PCs and storage devices.

 Some users might wonder what a semaphore is, which is an integer variable. The 0x80070079 error message highlights there’s been an operation timeout. This is how you can fix error 0x80070079 in Windows 11/10\.

## 1\. Try Transferring or Copying Files in Smaller Groups

 It might be the case that the 0x80070079 error occurs on your PC because of an issue with one particularly large file in a group.

### Disable Your Antivirus Shields

 If you’ve installed a third-party antivirus (security) utility, that might be causing the issue by preventing or restricting data transfer between drives. Temporarily disable your antivirus software’s shield before selecting to move or copy files from one drive to another. To do that, click on the antivirus tool’s system tray icon with the right mouse button and select the disable shield option.

### Perform a Clean Boot

 Some users confirm performing a clean boot fixes error 0x80070079\. Applying a clean boot will disable all third-party startup apps and services from starting. This resolution might eliminate third-party background program conflicts interfering with the data transfer and causing error 0x80070079\.

 You can apply this resolution by following the instructions in our [guide to performing a clean boot](https://www.makeuseof.com/clean-boot-windows-11/). Restart your PC when you’ve disabled all third-party startup items with Task Manager and System Configuration. Then copy or move the files you need to between drives after clean booting.

Check out [how to update Windows, apps, and drivers](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/update-windows-software-guide/) to give your PC a quick refresh, including your network adapter.

### Change Your External Drive to NTFS Format

 Some Windows PC users have fixed error 0x80070079 by reformatting their external USB drives to the NTFS format. The reason this resolution has worked for some users is probably that FAT32 can’t store single files larger than four gigabytes. Reformatting a FAT32 drive to NTFS will eliminate such a restriction.

![The Format window](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/format-seagate-drive.jpg)

 You can apply this possible resolution as covered within our guide to [reformatting USB drives in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-format-usb-drive-ntfs/).

 Reformatting a drive will wipe all the data on it. So, make sure you back up the drive’s data before reformatting if you want to keep any files on it.
