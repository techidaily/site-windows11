### 2\. Restart Your Computer

 If terminating the app doesn't do anything, do a system restart. It will clear all the apps from the memory, close all the background apps and services, and restart them. Do not use shutdown because Microsoft enables Fast start-up by default and that doesn't close system and kernel-level processes from the memory.

 After your computer restarts, launch Microsoft Store and try to install the Clipchamp app on your system.
