## Six Simple Steps for Briefly Pausing Windows 11'S Safety Measures

 Windows Security is the built-in security app for Windows 11\. You should always keep it enabled as it protects your computer from online and offline threats. However, you may come across situations where you might need to disable it.

 Whether you want to disable it for personal preference or install an app that's facing interference by it, here's how to temporarily disable Windows Security in Windows 11.

## 1\. Temporarily Disable Windows Security Using the Settings App

 The Settings app is the central hub of Windows OS, from where you can manage important system settings. You can use it to personalize your computer, change privacy settings, update Windows, and do much more. It's also one of the places to disable Windows Security on your computer. Here's how:

1. Press the**Win + I** hotkeys to open the**Settings** app.
2. Choose**Privacy & security** from the left sidebar.
3. Click the**Open Windows** **Security** button on the right pane.

4. In the Windows Security app, choose the**Virus & threats protection** option from the left sidebar.
5. Click**Manage settings** under the Virus & threats protection section.
6. Disable the toggle under the**Real-time protection** option.

## 2\. How to Temporarily Disable Windows Security Using the Registry Editor

 Windows Registry is a massive database of important settings and software installed on your computer. You can access and edit that database using a built-in tool called the Registry Editor.

 The Registry Editor can also come in handy in temporarily disabling Windows Security. Here's how to do that:

1. Open the**Start Menu** by pressing the**Win** key.
2. In the search bar, type**Windows Security** and press Enter.
3. Select**Virus & threat protection** from the left sidebar.
4. Turn off the toggle under the**Tamper protection** option.
