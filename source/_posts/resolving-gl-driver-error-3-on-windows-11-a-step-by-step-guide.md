## Resolving GL Driver Error 3 on Windows 11: A Step-by-Step Guide

 The NVIDIA OpenGL driver error code 3 is an issue that can arise on Windows 10 and 11 PCs with NVIDIA GPUs. Users have reported that error occurs when they launch or utilize software packages. That OpenGL issue crashes affected software either way. The error code 3 message says, “The NVIDIA OpenGL driver detected a problem with the display driver and is unable to continue.”

 Error code 3 has been reported to immediately close game, video, and image-editing software. Users must resolve that issue because it’s usually a recurring error. This is how you can fix error code 3 in Windows 10 and 11.

## 1\. Set the Prefer Maximum Performance Setting for Affected Software

 The NVIDIA Control Panel has alternative maximum performance and adaptive power management options. Error code 3 will more likely occur with the**Optimal power** setting selected. So, try selecting the**Prefer maximum performance** option like this:

1. Click a space on your desktop wallpaper with the right mouse button to select the**NVIDIA Control Panel option** on the context menu.
2. Then click the**plus** button for**3D Settings** .
3. Select the**Manage 3D Settings** tab on the left side of the NVIDIA Control Panel.
4. If your PC has two GPUs (graphics processor units), select the**High-performance NVIDIA** processor option on the**Preferred graphics processor** drop-down menu.

5. Click the**Power management mode** drop-down menu on the**Global Settings** tab.
6. Select the**Prefer maximum performance** option.

7. Press the NVIDIA Control Panel’s**Apply** button.
8. Then click**Start** ,**Power** , and the**Restart** option.

 Alternatively, you can set maximum performance specifically for an affected app instead. To do so, click the**Programs Settings** tab in NVIDIA Control Panel. Select the software for which error code 3 arises within the**Select a program to customize** drop-down menu. Then select**Prefer maximum performance** in the program settings and click**Apply** .

## 2\. Select the 3D App Visual Simulation Option

 Some users have fixed OpenGL error code 3 by selecting a**Visual Simulation** preset option within the NVIDIA Control Panel. However, note that option is only available for NVIDIA Quadro graphics adapters. So, you can’t see and select that setting if your PC doesn’t have a Quadro GPU. This is how to select the**3D App Visual Simulation** setting in the NVIDIA Control Panel:

1. Open Manage 3D Settings in the NVIDIA Control Panel as instructed in the first three steps of this guide’s first resolution.
2. Click the**Global Settings** tab in**Manage 3D** Settings.
3. Then click the**Global Preset** drop-down menu to open it.
4. Select the**3D App – Visual Simulation** setting on the menu.

5. Click**Apply** to set the selected preset option.

## 3\. Roll Back an NVIDIA Graphics Driver Update

 Have you recently updated your PC’s graphics driver? If so, the new driver could be causing the error code 3 issue on your PC. You might be able to resolve error code 3 by rolling back a recent graphics driver update.

 Follow our guide on [how to roll back a driver on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-roll-back-a-driver-in-windows-10/.) for more information. You'll find the display drivers under the**Display Adapters** section.

 A Driver Package rollback window will open that asks you to select an option about why you’re rolling back the driver. Click the**My apps don’t work with this driver** radio button, which is one of the closest matches for why you’re rolling back the driver.

 Select**Yes** to roll back the driver, then restart the PC before you try opening affected apps and games again.

## 4\. Select the Repair and Reset Options for the Affected App

 If error code 3 occurs for a Universal Windows Platform app or game, try fixing it with the**Repair** or**Reset** options. Each UWP app has options for repairing and resetting you can select within Settings. Check out our article about [resetting apps in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-reset-app/) to clear the app’s data.

 However, it’s recommended to select an app’s**Repair** option first. The**Repair** troubleshooting option is just about above the**Reset** button and doesn’t eradicate data. So, select**Repair** to see if that fixes error code 3 first.

## 5\. Reinstall the Affected Software

 The software for which error code 3 occurs might have corrupted DLL files. Reinstalling the affected software will repair corrupted files by replacing them with fresh new ones. You can remove desktop software or UWP apps via Settings or the Control Panel (Programs and Features) as outlined in our [article about uninstalling programs within Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/) .

![The Programs and Features Control Panel applet](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/programs-and-features3.jpg)

 Then reinstall the uninstalled program in Windows. First, download the latest software version, preferably from the publisher’s website. Open the folder containing the downloaded installer and double-click that setup wizard to reinstall its software.

## 6\. Cleanly Reinstall the NVIDIA Graphics Driver

 The OpenGL error code 3 message suggests an issue with your PC’s graphics (GPU) driver. Reinstalling the NVIDIA display driver could fix such an issue. We recommend that you cleanly reinstall your graphics card’s driver as covered in our guide to [cleanly reinstalling GPU drivers on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-cleanly-install-and-reinstall-gpu-drivers-on-windows/) .

## 7\. Reset Windows

 The last resort for fixing error code 3 (and many other Windows issues) is to reset the OS. Resetting Windows 11 or 10 reinstalls the platform, which restores it to a default factory configuration. Alas, the reset also wipes all third-party Windows software you’ve installed.

![The Reset this PC tool](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/reset-this-pc-tool.jpg)

 Therefore, resetting Windows is a drastic troubleshooting method, but it's also one that often works. Our guide on [how to reset Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/4-ways-factory-reset-windows-computer/#:~:text=If%20you're%20on%20Windows,Windows%2011%20and%20Windows%2010.) tells you how to apply this potential resolution with the Reset this PC tool. You can at least select to preserve all your user files by resetting your PC with that utility.

## Stop Error Code 3 Crashing Your Software on Windows

 Those potential fixes will probably stop error code 3 crashing software packages on most Windows 10 and 11 PCs. The most widely confirmed solutions for that OpenGL issue are to select the maximum performance and 3D App Visual Simulation settings in NVIDIA Control Panel. However, some users might need to reinstall affected apps and NVIDIA drivers or even reset Windows to get this issue fixed.
