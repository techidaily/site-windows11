## Steps for Fixing Execution Error with McUICnt.exe in Win 10/11

 The "McUICnt.exe entry point not found" error most commonly occurs on Windows when using a McAfee product, especially the McAfee antivirus suite. It usually happens right as you try to launch it, either because you opened the program manually or you set it to open by itself on startup.

 If you're tired of seeing this error when launching McAfee products on Windows, here's what you need to do to fix it.

## How to Fix the "McUICnt.exe Entry Point Not Found" Error on Windows

 Usually, the ["entry point not found" error on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/entry-point-not-found-error-windows/) points to a specific DLL file on Windows. This variation is unique, as it instead points to an executable within a McAfee product.

 Most users who encountered this error reported that uninstalling and reinstalling their McAfee products fixed the problem for them. McAfee itself recommends removing the app using one of the [many ways to uninstall software on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-different-ways-to-uninstall-software/), but if that doesn't work, it's time to use the McAfee Consumer Product Removal (MCPR) tool.

 If you want to uninstall McAfee products using the MCPR tool, follow these steps:

1. Download the MCPR tool from [McAfee Support](https://www.mcafee.com/support/?articleId=TS101331&page=shell&shell=article-view).
2. Upon downloading, run the executable file by double-clicking on it.
3. Once you accept the agreement and complete the security validation check, the tool will remove your McAfee products.

4. Upon completion of the process, you should see a **"Removal Complete"** message indicating that the software has been removed.

5. If you see this message, click **Restart** to reboot your device. If not, repeat the removal process.
6. Once your device boots up again, download and install the McAfee product you uninstalled.

 Hopefully, uninstalling McAfee products and reinstalling them from scratch will resolve the problem, and you won't reencounter the error.
