## A Comprehensive Guide to Wipeout MS Audit Reports on Your PC

 Windows Defender is Microsoft's antivirus built into your Windows PC to protect you from viruses, malware threats, and attacks. It maintains a record of its scans and actions in its Protection History folder.

 Though Protection History gets deleted after some time, you might want to have more control to clear it by yourself. So let's see how you can clear Protection History in four ways.

## What Is the Microsoft Defender Protection History? Why Should You Clear It?

 One of the best antivirus for your PC, [Windows Defender keeps getting better with some powerful upgrades](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-defender-riskai-upgrade/). The detections made by Windows Defender appear on the Protection History page—which means you can view actions that Microsoft Defender Antivirus has taken on your behalf. These would be scans done to identify and block malware and other threats. And also the recommendations (highlighted in red or yellow) for actions you should take.

 You also have access to all this information in a clear and easily understandable form, including Potentially Unwanted Apps that have been removed, or key services that have been turned off. The Protection History will also show the detections that appear while performing a Windows Defender Offline scan.

 Though Windows Defender keeps the history of its detections for 30 days, you can clear it before that time if you need to—for example, when a lot of scan logs have accumulated. Clearing the Protection History would help you make space on your PC and keep Defender running smoothly. Remember, you must be signed in as an administrator to clear the protection history so [do check if you have administrative rights](https://www.makeuseof.com/check-windows-account-admin-rights/).

 Now let's see four easy ways to clear Protection History in Windows 10 and 11\.
