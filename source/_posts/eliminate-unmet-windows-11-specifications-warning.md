## Eliminate Unmet Windows 11 Specifications Warning

### Key Takeaways

* Windows 11 has stricter hardware requirements, resulting in a "System requirements not met" watermark for unsupported hardware.
* You can remove the watermark by modifying the Registry Editor or using the Group Policy Editor.
* New updates may cause the watermark to reappear, requiring you to repeat the removal steps.

 If you are running Windows 11 on unsupported hardware, the newer operating system version will show a "System requirement not met" watermark in the bottom left corner of your screen.

 This may not be a concern if you use the OS in a virtual machine. But a watermark can stick out like a sore thumb for most people. Fortunately, you can remove the system requirements not met watermark with a registry hack and the Group Policy Editor.

## Why Does Windows 11 Show the "System Requirements Not Met" Watermark?

 Microsoft Windows 11 has a much [stricter hardware requirement](https://www.makeuseof.com/can-your-pc-run-windows-11/) than its predecessors. If your system does not meet the minimum system requirement, including TPM 2.0, the installation will stop abruptly.

 However, with the problem came many workarounds that allowed you to [bypass the restriction and install Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/bypass-windows-11-minimum-installation-requirements/) on unsupported hardware.

 While Microsoft initially allowed installation on unsupported hardware with a warning about security issues and lack of future updates, it has now [decided to put a permanent watermark](https://www.makeuseof.com/microsoft-windows-11-unsupported-watermark/) to remind the users that their system is not supported. A similar message may also appear in the Settings app.

 Follow these steps to remove the "System requirement not met" watermark in Windows 11:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the **Run** dialog.

6. Click **OK** to save the changes.
7. Close the Registry Editor and restart your PC to apply the changes. After restarting, Windows 11 will no longer show the unsupported hardware watermark.

 You can use the Group Policy Editor to turn off the System requirements not met message in Windows 11\. To achieve this, we’ll need to modify the **Hide messages when Windows system requirements are not met** Group Policy and set it to enabled.

 Only the Windows 11 Pro, Enterprise, and Education edition comes with the Local Group Policy Editor installed by default. If running the Home edition, follow these steps to [enable the Group Policy Editor in Windows Home](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/access-group-policy-editor-even-windows-home-settings-try/).

 To turn off the System requirement not message using GPedit:

1. Press **Win + R** to open the **Run** dialog.
2. Type **gpedit.msc** and click **OK** to open **Group Policy Editor**. Click **Yes** if prompted by **User Account Control**.
3. In Group Policy Editor, navigate to the following location:  
`Local Computer Policy > Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System`
4. In the right pane, scroll down and locate the **Hide messages when Windows system requirements are not met** policy.
