## How to Overcome Java VM Not Found On PC

 Your Windows 11 computer may require the latest version of Java installed for some applications to work. However, sometimes some Java apps may abruptly crash with the error Could not create the Java virtual machine.

 This error is often a case of insufficient memory allocation for Java apps. Additionally, check for permission issues and glitches with the Java release itself. If you are using it on your work computer for programming purposes, check if you have the correct version of Java IDE installed.

 Here we show you a few troubleshooting steps to fix the could not create the java virtual machine error on Windows.

## 1\. Verify Your Java Installation

![verify java installation command prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/verify-java-intallation-command-prompt.jpg)

 Verifying your Java installation can help you determine issues with the release itself. You can use the**java -version** command in Command Prompt to check the current version of Java installed along with the date of installation.

To check the Java version installed on Windows:

1. Press the**Win** key and type**cmd** .
2. Right-click on**Command Prompt** and select**Run as administrator** .
3. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command and press**Enter** :  
`java -version`
4. The output will list the JDK version installed on your computer and the installation date.
5. If you have recently installed an update, check if the information checks out. If not, try to install the latest version available from the [Java website](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/) .

## 2\. End the Java Process in Task Manager

 If the error is triggered when installing Java, check if a Java process is running in the background. You can use Task Manager to find and end background processes that may prevent you from installing the Java Runtime Environment or the development kit.

1. Press**Win + X** to open the**WinX menu** and select**Task Manager** .
2. In Task Manager, open the**Processes** tab and locate instances of**Java Virtual Machine** .
3. Select and click**End Task** to close the process.

## 3\. Run Java as an Administrator

 Insufficient permission can prevent some Java apps from running on your computer. To fix the problem, run Java with administrative privilege. To run Java as an administrator on Windows, right-click on**Java.exe** and select**Run as administrator** .

 Alternatively, you can set the Java.exe to always run as administrator. This way, you don’t need to run Java with administrative privileges each time you want to launch it.
