## Reversal of Extra Privileges: Win11 Standardization Tutorial

 Having issues with apps or programs not running properly on your Windows computer? Resetting Windows Update permissions could be the solution you need. Similarly, if you're troubleshooting user profile problems, you can restore user permissions.

 This article covers three different methods to reset all user permissions – using the Icacls command, the Secedit command, and the Subinacl tool.

Let's now explore them in detail.

## 1\. Run the Icacls Command

 The Icacls command allows you to view, modify, and reset file system permissions on files and folders. To reset Windows Update permissions using this command, you will first have to [take ownership of the folders on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-10-11-own-folder/) . Then [open an elevated Command Prompt on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/) and type in the following command:

`icacls * /t /q /c /reset`

 Now press Enter on your keyboard to execute the command. This will reset all user permissions to default for every folder, subfolder, and file within the current working directory.

In the above command, here are the parameters explained:

* \* – This is a wildcard character that includes all folders within the current directory.
* /t – It targets all the subfolders and files within the current folder.
* /q – Run command without displaying success messages.
* /c – Continues the operation even if errors occur.
* /reset – This parameter resets the permission options to their default values.

## 3\. Run the Subinacl Tool

 If you're not comfortable using the command prompt, you may use the Subinacl tool. This is a command-line utility from Microsoft that can be used to reset user permissions. Here's how to do it:

1. [Download the Subinacl tool from Microsoft's webpage](https://web.archive.org/web/20190830103837/http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=23510) . When you open the page, the download starts automatically. If not, wait 30 seconds and click the link.
2. Once downloaded, double-click on the installer package. This will open the installation wizard.

4. Next, copy and paste the following path into the Destination folder:  
`C:\Windows\System32`  
 Note: If you have installed Windows on a different drive, use that path instead.
5. Now click on**Install now** and wait for the Subinacl tool to be installed. This may take several minutes, so be patient.

1. When the installation is complete,[open Notepad](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-open-notepad/) and type in the following commands:  
`subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=administrators=f  
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=administrators=f  
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=administrators=f  
subinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive% /grant=administrators=f  
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=system=f  
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=system=f  
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=system=f  
subinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive% /grant=system=f`
2. On the Save As window, set the File name to**Reset.cmd** and then select**All Files** from the drop-down menu next to it.
