## Overcoming App Crashes in Windows: Dealing with Unhandled Exceptions

 Windows has a lot of error messages, but some of them are less descriptive than others. For example, you may come across the "unhandled exception has occurred in your application" error.

 However, it's not too tough to resolve this unhandled exception error. As such, if you encounter it, try the following tricks to fix the issue.

## What Does the "Unhandled Exception Has Occurred in Your Application" Error Mean?

 An exception is an unexpected event or situation when a computer program runs. Think of it as an unscheduled happening or error that interrupts whatever you're doing.

 Windows has inbuilt exception handling features whenever an error like this occurs. However, sometimes an unhandled exception occurs when a computer program or application does not properly handle exceptions.

 You can face the "unhandled exception has occurred in your application" error while working on applications or playing games. You can also experience it while opening a file or when you've just started up your PC.

 This error can occur if the .NET Framework is damaged or if there are some corrupt files or malware on your system.

 When this happens, you'll see a Microsoft .NET Framework window pop up on your PC screen, alerting you that an **"Unhandled error has occurred in your application"** . Annoyingly, this window will keep appearing even after you close it and until you've fixed the error.

 So let's explore the fixes you can try to quickly resolve this error and get back to working smoothly again.

## 2\. Scan for Malware Using Microsoft Defender or Your Antivirus

 There is a possibility that the "Unhandled exception has occurred in your application" error could be caused by malware. To rule that out, you should scan your computer with the inbuilt Microsoft Defender antivirus.

## 3\. Run the .NET Framework Repair Tool

 One of the most probable causes of the "Unhandled exception has occurred in your application" error is problems in the .NET Framework.

 To set them right, download and run the .NET Framework Repair tool from the [official Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30135&751be11f-ede8-5a0c-058c-2ee190a24fa6=True) .

## 5\. Use System File Checker on Windows

 Since corrupted files can also cause the "unhandled exception has occurred in your application" error, you can try running the System File Checker or SFC scan. You can easily learn how to do that in our guide on [how to run the SFC tool on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/) .

 Be patient as the SFC scan will take a few minutes. If the unhandled exception error was caused by corrupt files, you will see that the SFC would have scanned and fixed it.
