## Addressing XP709 Crash in Windows

 Have you encountered an error 0x00000709 with the message "Operation could not be completed. Double check the printer name and make sure that the printer is connected to the network" when setting up your default printer or installing a new one? This means Windows has failed to change your device's default printer or install a new one. But why?

 In this article, we will examine the error in more detail and discuss why it occurs. In addition, we'll cover a few fixes that you can apply to resolve the issue.

## An Overview of the "0x00000709: Operation Could Not Be Completed" Error

 The "0x00000709:operation could not be completed" error occurs when a user performs the [steps to change their default printer on Windows](https://www.makeuseof.com/set-the-default-printer-in-windows-10/), but Windows fails to do so. Users are further advised to verify that the printer name has been added correctly and that it is connected to the network. So, what can you do to fix it?

 To resolve the error code 0x00000709, you must first change the printer name in Registry Editor and then change the RPC connection settings policy. If these steps do not resolve the issue, you can run the printer troubleshooter, change the printer preferences settings, and uninstall the problematic update.

## 1\. Check for Interference From Other Printers

 Changing the default printer settings when your device is connected to multiple printers may result in a "0x00000709:operation could not be completed" error. Therefore, disconnect all other printers except the one you want to set as default before changing settings.

 If you continue to receive the error despite having no other printer connected to your device, then it is not interference from other printers causing the problem but rather a setting in your operating system. So, start applying the following fixes.

## 2\. Rename the Printer in Registry Editor

 The error message advises us to correctly set the printer's name. So, in this next step, we should rename it manually in Registry Editor. Although it is known to fix the problem, you need to be careful to follow the steps correctly. You should [avoid messing up registry keys](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/not-accidentally-mess-windows-registry/) as it can cause serious problems. As such, follow the instructions below:

1. In Windows Search, type **"Registry Editor."**
2. Right-click on the **Registry Editor** app and click on **Run as administrator**.
3. In the Registry Editor address bar, paste the following path:  
`Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows`
4. Right-click on the **Device** key and click **Modify**.

5. In the **Value data** field, replace the first entry with the name of your printer.  
![Editing String by Changing Its Data Value in Registry Editor App on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/editing-string-by-changing-its-data-value-in-registry-editor-app-on-windows.jpg)
6. Then click **OK**.

 Make sure you restart your computer after completing the above steps. If renaming the registry keys makes no difference, apply the remaining fixes.

## 3\. Change RPC Connection Settings

 Once you've changed the printer name, you should ensure your printer is connected to the network. If it's connected, but you're still getting the error, modify the RPC connection settings in the group policy editor. This policy controls the protocol settings for outgoing RPC connections to a remote print spooler.

 To enable and change the policy settings, follow these steps:

1. Type **"Group Policy"** in Windows Search. See [how to find and use Windows Search](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-search-use-guide/) if you need help with this.
2. Click on **Edit group policy**.
3. In the left-sidebar, select **Administrative Templates > Printers**.  
![Clicking on the Printers Option in the Administrative Templates Dropdown in Windows Group Policy Editor App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/3-clicking-on-the-printers-option-in-the-administrative-templates-dropdown-in-windows-group-policy-editor-app.jpg)
4. Click **Configure RPC connection** **settings** twice.
5. To enable this policy, check the circle for **Enabled**.
6. Select **RPC over named pipes** from the dropdown menu for **Protocol to use for outgoing RPC connections.**  
![Selecting RPC Over Named Pipes from the Dropdown Menu of Protocol to Use for Outgoing RPC Connections in Windows Group Policy Editor App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/4-selecting-rpc-over-named-pipes-from-the-dropdown-menu-of-protocol-to-use-for-outgoing-rpc-connections-in-windows-group-policy-editor-app.jpg)
7. Hit **OK** after clicking **Apply**.
8. Restart your device.

 If the above instructions don't work, you can select **RPC over TCP** from the **Protocol to use for outgoing RPC connections** dropdown.

 When that doesn't work either, you can enable or disable authentication from the **Use authentication for outgoing RPC connections** dropdown menu.

 Apply this fix carefully, as it has the highest chance of fixing the error message.

## 4\. Run the Printer Troubleshooter

 To troubleshoot printer-related issues, Windows includes an in-built troubleshooter. The tool helps diagnose and fix most problems related to printer connectivity. If you try it, it may resolve the "operation could not be completed" error. To run the troubleshooter, follow the steps below:

1. Right-click the **Start** button and select **Settings**.
2. Select the **System** tab from the left sidebar.
3. In the right pane, click **Troubleshoot**.  
![Clicking on the Troubleshoot Option in the System Tab of the Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/7-clicking-on-the-troubleshoot-option-in-the-system-tab-of-the-windows-settings-app.jpg)
4. Click **Other troubleshooters**.
5. Locate the **Printer** troubleshooter, and click on the **Run** button next to it.  
![Clicking on the Run Button Next to Printer Troubleshooter in Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/8-clicking-on-the-run-button-next-to-printer-troubleshooter-in-windows-settings-app.jpg)
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to help the troubleshooter get started.

 After that, make your preferred printer your default printer again. In case the same error occurs again, apply the next fix.

## 5\. Change Printer Preferences

 By default, Windows manages the default printer for the user. The setting is helpful, especially if you frequently connect your device to different printers, but it can sometimes cause problems. Hence, you should disable this feature to ensure it is not causing the problem.

 To do that, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the **Start** button and select **Settings**.
2. Select the **Bluetooth & devices** tab from the left sidebar.
3. In the right pane, click **Printers & scanners**.  
![Going to Printers and Scanners Settings in the Bluetooth and Devices Tab of the Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/9-going-to-printers-and-scanners-settings-in-the-bluetooth-and-devices-tab-of-the-windows-settings-app.jpg)
4. Turn off the toggle next to **Allow Windows to manage my default printer** under **Printer preferences**.

## 6\. Uninstall the Problematic Update

 Have you recently installed an update and encountered this error? If so, the newly installed update might be problematic. Therefore, you should uninstall it. To do that, follow these steps:

1. Press **Win + I** to open the Windows **Settings** app.
2. In the left sidebar, click **Windows Update**.
3. In the right pane, click on **Update history**.  
![Clicking on Update History in the Windows Update Tab of the Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/11-clicking-on-update-history-in-the-windows-update-tab-of-the-windows-settings-app.jpg)
4. Under **Related settings**, click **Uninstall updates**.  
![Clicking on Uninstall Updates Under Related Settings in Update History Settings in Windows Settings App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/12-clicking-on-uninstall-updates-under-related-settings-in-update-history-settings-in-windows-settings-app.jpg)
5. Find the most recent update in the Control Panel app by checking its installation date. Once it has been located, right-click on it and click **Uninstall**.  
![Uninstalling the Recent Windows Update after Locating it in the Windows Control Panel App](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/13-uninstalling-the-recent-windows-update-after-locating-it-in-the-windows-control-panel-app.jpg)

 See if you encounter the same error again. If uninstalling a problematic update resolves the issue, you should take extra steps to prevent this update from automatically installing again. You can do that by following these steps:

1. Download Microsoft's show or hide updates troubleshooter from [MajorGeeks](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/microsoft%5Fshow%5For%5Fhide%5Fupdates%5Ftroubleshooter.html).
2. Once the file has been downloaded, run it.
3. Let the tool detect problems by clicking **Next**.
4. Click on **Hide updates**.  
![Clicking on the Hide Updates Option After Clicking on the Next Button in Microsoft's Show or Hide Updates Troubleshooter](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/14-clicking-on-the-hide-updates-option-after-clicking-on-the-next-button-in-microsoft-s-show-or-hide-updates-troubleshooter.jpg)
5. The tool will display the problematic update you uninstalled.
6. Check the box for it and click **Next**.

 Let the tool finish processing, and the specific update will not install on your device again. However, if uninstalling the update makes no difference, there is no need to prevent it from installing again.
