## How To Silence Your License Will End Soon Warning on WOSes

 Have you encountered the alarming "your Windows license will expire soon" error message on your PC? That usually happens when the Windows license on your PC is expired or deemed invalid. However, if your Windows license is indeed genuine, there might be another issue preventing Microsoft from authenticating it properly.

 In the following sections, we will discuss the common causes behind this error and provide potential solutions to fix it.

## Why Does the “Your Windows License Will Expire Soon” Error Appear?

 The "Your Windows license will expire soon" error message can occur due to several factors, and here are the most prevalent ones:

* **Windows license is invalid:** Using an unauthorized or pirated version of Windows is one of the most common reasons why you might encounter this error message.
* **Hardware changes:** Performing hardware changes, such as replacing the motherboard in your system, can also lead to activation errors on Windows.
* **Connectivity issues:** Your computer might fail to connect to the Key Management Service (KMS) server due to network-related issues, resulting in activation errors.
* **Corrupt Activation Token files:** The **Tokens.dat** file contains the activation information for your Windows installation. If this file becomes inaccessible for some reason, you may encounter the “Your Windows license will expire soon” error on Windows.

## 1\. Apply Some Preliminary Fixes

 Before you try any advanced troubleshooting tips, it’s a good idea to start with some basic fixes.

* **Restart Windows Explorer:** Temporary issues with the Windows Explorer process can sometimes trigger the “Your Windows license will expire soon” error on your PC. If it’s nothing major, you should be able to fix it by simply [restarting the Windows Explorer process](https://www.makeuseof.com/ways-to-restart-file-explorer-windows-10/).
* **Run the SFC Scan:** It’s possible that Microsoft is having trouble authenticating your Windows license due to corrupt or damaged system files. To repair these files, you can try [running the System File Checker (SFC) scan on your PC](https://www.makeuseof.com/system-file-checker-sfc-windows/).
* **Scan for Malware:** Another potential factor contributing to Windows activation issues is malware infection. To address this, you can try [scanning your PC for malware using PowerShell](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-powershell-to-scan-windows-10-for-malware/) or Microsoft Defender.

## 2\. Run the Activation Troubleshooter

 Both Windows 10 and 11 offer various troubleshooters for addressing common system issues. In this case, you can take help from the Windows Activation troubleshooter to fix any issues that may have caused the “Your Windows license will expire soon” error on your PC.

 To run the Activation troubleshooter, use these steps:

 Wait for the troubleshooter to do its thing, and then check if it resolves the error.

## 3\. Find Your Product Key and Activate Windows

 Another thing you can do to fix this error is to find your product key using the ShowKeyPlus app and then attempt to activate Windows again. Several users on the forums reported fixing the error with this method. You can also give it a go.

1. [Download the ShowKeyPlus app](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PKVZCPRX9NV) from the Microsoft Store.
2. Open the ShowKeyPlus app using the search menu.
3. Note down the **OEM key** in the **Home** tab.  
![ShowKeyPlus App on Windows](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/showkeyplus-app-on-windows.jpg)

## 4\. Activate Windows Using Command Prompt

 If you are unable to activate Windows via the Settings app, you can try to activate it through the Command Prompt. To do so, make sure that your PC is connected to the internet, and then use these steps:

1. Click the **magnifying icon** on the taskbar to access the search menu.
2. Type **cmd** in the box and select **Run as administrator**.
3. Select **Yes** when the User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears.
4. Type **slmgr /ato** in the console and press Enter.  
![Activate Windows via Command Prompt](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/activate-windows-via-command-prompt.jpg)

 Wait for Command Prompt to validate your product key. You will see a message confirming the outcome of the activation process, whether it was successful or not. If the activation is successful, you should not see the “Your Windows license will expire soon” error after this.

## 5\. Rebuild the Tokens.dat File

 Tokens.dat is a system file related to Windows activation and licensing. If this file somehow gets corrupted, Windows may have trouble verifying the authenticity of your license and trouble you with the “Your Windows license will expire soon” error.

 You can try rebuilding the Tokens.dat file on your PC to see if that fixes the error. Here are the steps for the same.

1. Right-click on the **Start icon** or use the **Win + X** keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu.
2. Select **Terminal (Admin)** from the list.
3. Type the following commands one by one and press **Enter** after each.  
`net stop sppsvc  
cd %windir%\system32\spp\store\2.0  
ren tokens.dat tokens.bar  
net start sppsvc  
cscript.exe %windir%\system32\slmgr.vbs /rilc`

 Restart your computer after running the above commands and then check if you still get the “Your Windows license will expire soon” error on your PC.

## 6\. Reset the Licensing Status

 In case your Windows license is not genuine, there's a workaround to dismiss the “Your Windows license will expire soon” message. This workaround involves resetting the activation period and [hiding the Activate Windows watermark](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/remove-activate-windows-10-watermark/) via Command Prompt. Here are the steps you can follow.

1. [Open Command Prompt with administrative privileges](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-run-command-prompt-admin/).
2. Type **slmgr /rearm** in the console and press **Enter**.
3. Restart your PC after running the command.  
![Reset the Activation Timer](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/reset-the-activation-timer.jpg)

 It's worth noting that you can only utilize the above command a few times. Eventually, you will have to obtain a genuine Windows license to eliminate the error message permanently.
