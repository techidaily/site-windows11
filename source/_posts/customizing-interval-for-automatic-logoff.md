## Customizing Interval for Automatic Logoff

 The Windows lock screen usually displays images when you power on your device or wake it from sleep mode. By default, the lock screen will only appear for about a minute, and then your screen will go blank.

 Meanwhile, the screen saver is an image or animation that appears when your PC has been inactive for a while. Just like the lock screen, the screen saver will also appear for about one minute.

 Wondering how you can display the lock screen or screen saver for longer?

 This article will show you the various ways to change the Windows lock screen and screen saver timeout settings.
