## From Separate to Shared: Android-PC Harmony Guide

 When you sync your Android with Windows, you get a host of decentralizing benefits, such as the ability to share your data or control across multiple devices or nodes, protection from single points of failure, etc.

 In practical terms, you can make phone calls, read and send text messages, get notifications, and more—straight from your PC. So let’s look at all the different ways to connect your Android to a Windows PC.

## How to Sync Your Android With Windows

 Interestingly, there's a vast diversity of ways to record your files on Windows. In fact, there are more than a few ways to do this: Phone Link app, Unison app, and even third-party apps like AirDroid are a few examples.
