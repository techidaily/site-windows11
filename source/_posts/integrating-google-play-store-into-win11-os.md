## Integrating Google Play Store Into Win11 OS

 You can natively run Android apps on Windows 11 via Windows Subsystem for Android (WSA); however, it has its limitations. The new OS only natively supports Amazon’s Appstore and not Google Play Store. And while sideloading Android apps is an option, anything that requires Google Play Services will not work.

 However, you can install Google Play Store on Windows 11 to overcome this limitation. Here we show you how.

## How to Install Google Play Store on Windows 11

 As discussed earlier, you can [sideload and run Android apps on Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-sideload-android-apps/) . However, finding APKs and installing them via the Command Prompt is cumbersome. You also need to configure Android Debug Bridge (ADB) to install Android apps.

 You can install a fully functional Google Play Store to remedy this problem. Also, this allows you to run Google Play Services-dependent apps.

 However, it is a complicated process and involves downloading several small packages and then moving them around. Fortunately, a developer (Yujinchang08) on GitHub has simplified this process with a custom WSA installer.

 The WSA installer consists of a modified WSA package with Magisk and Open GApps integration. Magisk is a root access utility wherein Open GApps offers up-to-date Google Apps packages.

 For this guide, we will focus on the second method to install Google Play Store on Windows 11\. So, let’s begin.

 Note that this process requires installing third-party modified files and packages and involves potential risks. Before proceeding,[create a restore point in Windows 11](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-create-restore-point/) or [recovery drive](http://www.makeuseof.com/create-recovery-drive-system-repair-disc-windows-10/) . These recovery options can help you undo the changes or repair the system if something goes wrong.

## Step 1: Uninstall Android Subsystem for Android

![uninstall windows subsystem for android](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/uninstall-windows-subsystem-for-android.png)

 If you have Windows Subsystem for Android installed, you can uninstall it from the Apps & features section.

To uninstall WSA:

1. Press**Win + I** to open the**Settings** panel.
2. Open the**Apps** tab in the left pane.
3. Next, click on**Apps & Features.**
4. Locate and click on**Windows Subsystem for Android** under**App list** .
5. Click the**three dots** and select**Uninstall** . Click**Uninstall** again to confirm the action.

## Step 2: Enable Developer Mode in Windows 11

![enable-developer-mode-windows-11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/enable-developer-mode-windows-11.png)
