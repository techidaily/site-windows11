## Enhanced Sound Mastery with Microsoft's Updated Clipchamp Software

Clipchamp is the main video editor on Windows 10 and Windows 11, and it's available as a web app on other platforms. Microsoft is now rolling out a few improvements to Clipchamp, mostly focused on audio editing.

[Clipchamp](https://fox-http.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-iphone-photography-handbook-tips-and-tricks/) now has the ability to record voiceovers directly in the active project, instead of using another application (like the Voice Recorder app in Windows) and importing the audio file. You can start by switching to the "Record and Create" tab in the sidebar, and selecting "Audio." Clipchamp supports recordings of up to 30 minutes, and they can be used to create automatic captions. It's available now for all personal Microsoft accounts.

 Microsoft has also improved Clipchamp's text-to-speech feature, available now for all personal accounts and starting to roll out for work accounts. The blog post explains, "You can now add a text to speech track item, and then change the language, voice, emotion, pitch, as well as edit the script from the property panel. By leveraging these new capabilities, you can both fine-tune your script and make those last-minute changes while also updating the voice track as you go. Weâ€™ve also added a pace option so you can change the speed of your AI voiceover."

 There's one more audio improvement coming to Clipchamp, but with a catch. The app will be able to detect long silences in audio tracks, and give you the option of removing them automatically. Microsoft says this is can be useful for editing podcast recordings, long meetings, voiceovers, or educational videos. It will start rolling out as a free preview feature to personal accounts later in February, but once it leaves preview, it will require [Clipchamp Premium](https://clipchamp.com/en/pricing/). That currently costs $12 per month (or $120 per year), and also gives you watermark-free exports, premium filters and effects, content backup, and other features.

 Annoyingly, Clipchamp Premium still isn't included in Microsoft 365 personal or family subscriptions. The built-in Photos app on Windows 11 has some more basic editing features for free, and while they do have a steeper learning curve, some professional video editors like [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) and [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) are also free to use.
