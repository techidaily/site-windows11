## Prolific Path to Success: Top 7 Boosting Tools for Window 11

 If you’re looking for ways to be more productive on your Windows device, why not explore widgets? There are many great widgets available for Windows 11 to save time and be more organized.

 Widgets are a fast and easy way to view important updates at a glance, and it’s simple to get started. Here’s a list of the best Windows 11 widgets to improve your productivity.

## How to Add Widgets in Windows 11

![Widgets settings in Windows 11](https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/widgets-settings-in-windows-11.jpg)

 Before installing widgets, it’s important to know how to access them and where to find widgets. With the help of keyboard shortcuts, accessing widgets in Windows 11 is easy.

 To open the widgets board, use the shortcut **Windows + W**. From here, you can view all installed widgets and add new ones. To add a new widget, hit the **plus** icon (**+**) at the top of the widgets board. Here, you can view all widgets created by Microsoft and access the Microsoft Store to explore further widgets. You can also [pin widgets to your desktop](https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-11-add-widgets-desktop/) using a third-party app.

 To access all of Microsoft’s widgets, you’ll need to be signed in to your Microsoft account. Click the profile icon at the top right of the widgets board. At the top of the widget settings, hit the sign-in button to log in to your Microsoft account. Let’s explore the best widgets to boost your productivity.

## 1\. Outlook Calendar
